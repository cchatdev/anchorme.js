INTRODUCTION 

The Time Traveller (for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. 
Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way— marking the points with a lean fore- 
finger — as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must follow me carefully. I shall have to con- 
trovert one or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two ideas that are almost universally accepted. 
The geometry, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, they taught you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt at school is* 
founded on a misconception.” 

Ts not that rather a large thing to expect us to be^n upon?’ said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair. 

‘I do not mean to ask you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to accept anything without reasonable ground for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will soon admit as much as I need from you. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know of course that a mathema- 
tical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. 
They taught you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that? Neither has a mathematical plane. 
These things are mere abstractions.’ 

‘That is all right,’ said the Psychologist. 

‘Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.’ 
TIME MACHINE 

"11161*81, 1 object,’ said Filby. ‘Of course a solid body may exist. All real things ’ 

‘So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?’ 

‘Don’t follow you,’ said Filby. 

‘Can a cube that does not last for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt any time at all, have a real existence?’ 

Filby became pensive. ‘Clearly,’ the Time Traveller proceeded, ‘any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and — 
Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, 
which I will explain to you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in a moment, we incline to over- 
look this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth. 
Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the 
•latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.’ 

‘That,’ said a very young man, making spasmodic eflbrts to relight his cigar over the lamp; ‘that . . . very clear indeed.* 

‘Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively 
‘overlooked,’ continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. ‘Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?’ 

‘/have not,’ said the Provincial Mayor. 

‘It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always 
INTRODUCTION 9 

definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly — ^why not another direction at right angles to the other three? — and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so ago. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional sohd, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four — if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?’ 

‘I think so,’ murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, 
knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. ‘Yes, I think 1 see it jiow,’ he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner. 

‘Well, I do not mind telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some time. 
Some of my results are curious. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, 
another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. 
All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimen-* 
sional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, 
which is a fixed and unalterable thing.’ 

‘Scientific people,’ proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause requiied for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the proper assimilation of this, 
‘know very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. 
Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. 
Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.’ 
10 
THE TIME MACHINE 
said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal io the fire, ‘if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, 
why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as some- 
thing different? And why cannot we move about in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?’ 

The Time Traveller smiled. ‘Are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so sure we car move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. 
I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.’ 

‘Not exactly,’ said the Medical Man. ‘There are balloons.’ 

‘But before the balloons, save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.’ 

‘Still they could move a little up and down,’ said the Medical Man. 

‘Easier, far easier down than up.’ 

‘And you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cannot move at all in Time, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cannot get away from the present moment.’ 

‘Kly dear sir, that is Just where you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are 
’always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, arc passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.’ 

‘But the great difficulty is this,’ interrupted the Psychol- 
ogist. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can move about in all directions of Space, 
but you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cannot move about in Time.’ 

‘That is the germ of my great discovery. But you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: 1 become absent-minded, 
as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say. I jump back for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment. Of course we 
INTRODUCTION 
11 
have no means of staying back for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt any length of Time, 
any more than a savage or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt even turn about and travel the other way?’ 

‘Oh, this,' began Filby, ‘is all ’ 

‘Why not?’ said the Time Traveller. 

‘It's against reason,’ said Filby. 

‘What reason?’ said the Time Traveller. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can show black is white by argument,’ said Filby, 
‘but you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will never convince me.’ 

‘Possibly not,’ said the Time Traveller. ‘But now you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine ’ 

‘To travel through Time! ’exclaimed the Very Young Man. 

‘That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver determines.’ 

Filby contented himself with laughter. 

‘But I have experimental verification,’ said the Time Traveller. 

‘It would be remarkably convenient for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the historian,’ 
the Psychologist suggested. ‘One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance!’ 

‘Don’t you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would attract attention?’ said the Medical Man, ‘Our ancestors had no great tolerance for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt anachronisms.’ 

‘One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,’ the Very Young Man thought. 

‘ In which case they would certainly plough you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Little-go. The German scholars have improved Greek so much.’ 
12 THE TIME MACHINE 

‘Then there is the future,’ said the Very Young Man. 
'Just think I One might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!’ 

‘To discover a society,’ said I, ‘erected on a strictly communistic basis.' 

‘Of all the wild extravagant theories!’ began the Psychologist. 

‘Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until ’ 

‘Experimental verification!’ cried 1. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are going to verify that?' 

‘The experiment!’ cried Filby, who was getting brain- 
weary. 

‘Let’s see your experiment anyhow,’ said the Psychol- 
ogist, ‘though it’s all humbug, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know.’ 

The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shufiSing down the long passage to his laboratory. 

The Psychologist looked at us. ‘I wonder what he’s got?’ 

. ‘Some sleight-of-hand trick or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt other,’ said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s anecdote collapsed. 
2 

THE MACHINE 

The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small dock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, 
and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I 
THE MACHINE 
13 
must be explicit, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this that follows — ^unless his explanation is to be accepted — ^is an absolutely unaccountable thing. 
He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scat- 
tered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, 
the bright light of which fell full upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. 
Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt watched him in profile from ttte right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions. 

The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. ‘Well?’ said the Psychologist. 

‘This little affair,’ said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, ‘is only a model. It is my plan for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a machine to travel through time. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar. as though it was in some way unreal.’ He pointed to the part with his finger. ‘Also, 
here is one little white lever, and here is another.’ 

The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. ‘ It’s beautifully made,’ he said. 

‘It took two years to make,’ retorted the Time Traveller. 
Then, when we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: ‘Now I want you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt clearly to understand that 
14 THE TIME MACHINE 

this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. 
It will vanish, pass into future time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told Tm a quack.’ 

There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towards the lever. 
‘No,’ he said suddenly. ‘Lend me your hand.’ And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage.^* We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no tricker}\ There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a second perhaps, as an eddy- of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone— vanished ! Save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the lamp the tabic was bare. 

Every one was silent for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute. Then Filby said he was damned. 

The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully, ‘Well?’ he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe. 

We stared at each other. ‘ Look here,’ said the Medical Man, ‘are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in earnest about this? Do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?’ 

. ‘Certainly,’ said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look 
THE MACHINE 
15 
at the Psychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) ‘What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there’ — he indicated the laboratory — ‘and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.’ 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?’ said Filby. 

‘ Into the future or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the past — I don’t, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt certain, know which.’ 

After an interval the Ps3'chologist had an inspiration. 

‘ It must have gone into the past if it has gone anyw'here,’ 
he said. 

‘Why?’ said the Time Traveller. 

‘ Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travellcd-into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time.’ 

‘But,’ said I, ‘if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!’ 

‘Serious objections,’ remarked the Provincial Mayor, 
with an air of impartiality, turning towards the Timfe Traveller. 

‘Not a bit,’ said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychol- 
ogist : ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think. yio« can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, diluted presentation.’ 

‘Of course,’ said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 
‘That’s a simple point in psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. Wc cannot see it, nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can w'c appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling tlirough time fifty times or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a hundred limes faster than we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only 
16 
THE TIME MACHINE 
one-fiftieth or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.’ He passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see?’ he said, laughing. 

We sat and stared at the vacant table for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so. Then the Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all. 

‘It sounds plausible enough to-night,’ said the Medical Man; ‘but wait until to-morrow. Wait for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the common- 
sense of the morning.’ 

‘Would you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like to see the Time Machine itself?’ asked the Time Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughty corridor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, 
his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, 
and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sawn out of rock crystal. The thing v/as generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a better look at it. Quartz it seemed to be. 

‘Look here,’ said the Medical Man, ‘are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt perfectly serious? or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt is this a trick — Uke that ghost you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt showed us last Christmas?’ 

‘Upon that machine,’ said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, ‘I intend to explore time. Is that plain? 
I was never more serious in my life.’ 

None of us quite knew how to take it. 

I caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he winked at me solemnly.

THE TIME TRAVELLER RETURNS 
I THINK that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed : you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt never felt that you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw all round him; you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt always sus- 
pected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, 
behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown him far less scepticism. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could under- 
stand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whiiTvamong his elements, and we distrusted him. 
Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment: they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. 
So I don't think any of us said very much about time’ 
travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incred- 
ibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain. 

The ne.xt Thursday I went again to Richmond — I suppose I was one of the lime Traveller’s most constant guests— 
IS THE TIME MACHINE 

and, arriving late, found four or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing be- 
fore the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. I looked round for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Time Traveller and — ‘It’s half-past seven now,’ said the Medical Man. 
‘I suppose we’d better have dinner?’ 

‘Where’s ?’ said I, naming our host. 

‘You've just come? it’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says he'll explain when he comes.’ 

‘It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,’ said the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt rang the bell. 

The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and myself who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt afore-mentioned, a certain journalist, and another — a quiet, shy man with a beard 
—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a 
•half jocular spirit. The Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ‘ingenious paradox and trick’ we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt from the corridor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt opened slowly and with- 
out noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first. ‘Hallo ! ’ 
I said. ‘At last!’ And the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. 
‘Good heavens! man, what’s the matter?’ cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door. 

He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me srever— either with 
THE TIME TRAVELLER RETURNS 19 

dust and dirt or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt because its colour had actually faded. 
His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it 
— a cut half-healed ; his expression was haggard and drawn, 
as by intense suffering. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. ' We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak. 

He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, 
and made a motion towards the wine. The Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he looked round the table, and the gho.st of his old smile flickered across his face. ‘What on earth have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt been up to, 
man?’ said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. ‘Don’t let me disturb you,’ he said, with a certain faltering articulation. ‘I’m all right.’ He stopped, held out his glass for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more, and took it off at a draught. ‘That's good,’ he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still, 
as it were feeling his way among his words. ‘I’m going to wash and dress, and then I'll come down and explain things. . . . Save me some of that mutton. Tm starving for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a bit of meat.’ 

He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, 
and hoped he was all right. The Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt began a question. 
‘Tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt presently,’ said the Time Traveller. ‘ I'm — funny! 
Be all right in a minute.’ 

He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had notliing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered 
20 THE TIME MACHINE 

how he detested any fuss about himself. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute, 
perhaps, my mind was wool gathering. Then, ‘ Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,’ I heard the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say, 
thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table. 

‘What’s the game?’ said the Journalist. ‘Has he been doing the Amateui’ Cadger? I don’t follow.’ I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my own interpretation in his face. 
I thought of the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs. 
I don’t think any one else had noticed his lameness. 

The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man, who rang the bell — the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner— foi" a hot plate. 
At that the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt turned to his knife and fork with a grunt, and the silent man followed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory fo? a little while, 
with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt got fervent in his curiosity. ‘Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?’ he inquired. ‘I feel assured it’s this business of the Time Machine,’ I said, and took up the Psychologist’s jaccount of our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt raised objections. ‘What way this time travelling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?’ And theu, 
as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature. 
Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist, too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of journalist 
— very jo yous, irreverent young men. ‘ Our Special Corres- 
pondent in the Day after To-morrow reports,’ the Journalist was saying — or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt rather shouting— when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, 
and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me. 
THE TIME TRAVELLER RETURNS 21 

‘I say,’ said the Editor, hilariously, ‘these chaps here say you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have been travelling into the middle of next week!! 
Tell us all about little Rosebery, will you? What win you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt take for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the lot?’ 

The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him without a word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 
‘Where’s my mutton?’ he said. ‘What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again ! ’ 

‘Story!’ cried the Editor. 

‘Story be damned!’ said the Time Traveller. ‘I want something to eat. I won’t say a word until 1 get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.’ 

‘One word,’ said I. ‘Have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt been time travelling?’ 

‘Yes,’ said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, 
nodding his head. 

‘ I’d give a shilling a line for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a verbatim note,’ said the Editor. The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards 
(he Silent Man and rang it with his finger nail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and 1 dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, 
and watched the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. 
The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away, and looked round us. ‘I suppose I must apologize,’ he said. ‘I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing time.’ He reached out his hand for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a cigar, 
and cut the end. ‘But come into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.’ And ringing the bell in nassine. he led the wav into the adioininn room. 
22 
THE TIME MACHINE 
‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?’ he said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests. * 

‘But the thing’s a mere paradox,’ said the Editor. 

‘I can’t argue to-night. I don't mind telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the story, but I can’t argue. I will,’ he went on, ‘tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the story of what has happened to me, if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like, but you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must refrain from interruptions. I want to tell it. 

' Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it ! It’s true — every word of i t, al 1 the same. I was in my laboratory at four o’clock, and since then . . . I’ve lived eight days 
. . . such days as no human being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till I’ve told this thing over to you. Tlien I shall go to bed. But no interruptions ! 
Is it agreed?’ 

.‘Agreed,’ said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 
‘Agreed.’ And with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink — and, above all, my own inadequacy — to express its quality. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt read, 
I will suppose, attentively enough; but you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hear the intonation of his voice. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s face.

TIME TRAVELLING 

‘I TOLD some of you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the actual thing itself, 
incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a little travel -worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, 
and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s sound enough. 
I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this T had to get re-made; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o’clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. 
I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensatioh of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted llie clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three! 

‘ I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in, and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot gcross the room like a rocket, I pressed the lever over to its extreme 
24 THE TIME MACHINE 

position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, 
and in another moment came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. To- 
morrow night came black, then day again, night again, 
day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind. 

‘I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback— 
of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. 
The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every mipute marking a' day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, 
as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous grey ness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of lire, a brilliant arch, in space, the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, 
save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue. 

‘The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green: 
TIME TRAVELLING 25 

they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw hage buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. 
The whole surface of the earth seemed changed — melting and flowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun-belt swayed op and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt less, and that, consequently, my pace was over a year a mieoto; 
and minute by minute the white snow flashed acrou the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, 
brief green of spring. 

‘The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked, indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt which I was unable to account. But nay mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. 
At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But presently a thssh series of impressions grew up in my miud-f-a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they took complete possession of me. What strange develop- 
ments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear wheit I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. 1 saw a richer green flow up tho hill-side, and remain there without any wintry intermission. 
Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the busineM of stopping. 

‘The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which I, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the machian, 
occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity throngki

THE TIME MACHINE 
time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to speak, attenuated 
— ^was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into what- 
ever lay in my way: meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction — possibly a far-reaching explosion — 
would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions — into the Unknown. This possi- 
bility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk — one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The fact is that, insen- 
sibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above *11, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. 1 told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, 
I lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and T was flung headlong through the air. 

‘There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. 
*I may have been stunned for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, 
but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail- 
stones. The rebounding, dancing bail hung in a little cloud over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. “Fine hospitality,” said I, “to a man who has travelled innumer- 
able years to see you.” 

‘Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I 
TIME TRAVELLING 
27 
Stood up and looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible. 

‘My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a silver birch tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, 
and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; 
there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little space — half a minute, perhaps, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail di ove before it denser or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment, 
and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun. 

‘I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and. 
the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. 
What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men? 
What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness, and bad developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt our common likeness — a foul creature to be incontinently slain. 

‘Already I saw other vast shapes— huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill- 
side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm. 

I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the 
» THE TIME MACHINE 

TSine Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I did BO the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. 
The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wins above and will swoop. 
My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again. 

‘But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circular opening, 
high up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of 
.figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their faces were directed towards me. 

‘Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature— perhaps four feet hi^ — clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt buskins — I could not clearly distinguish which — ^were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time how warm the air was. 

‘He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creatpre, but indescribably frail. His flushed face re- 
minded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive— 
IN THE GOLDEN AGE 2 ^ 

that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. 
At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands from the machine. 
5 

IN THE GOLDEN AGE 

‘In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue. 

‘There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt them. So I shook my head, and pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, 
and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence — a graceful gentle- 
ness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But 1 made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine, I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication. 
JO THE TIME MACHINE 

‘And then, looking more nearly into their features, 
I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden cliina type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, 
came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild ; and — this may seem 
'egotism on my part — I fancied even then that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them. 

‘As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then, hesitating for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder. 

‘For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may hardly understand how it took me. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children 
— asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes, their frail light limbs and fragile features. 
A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment I felt that I had built the Time Machine in vain. 

‘I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers 
IN THE GOLDEN AGE 3r 

altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to and fro for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then some one suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble, 
which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind. 

‘The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadow 7 and mysterious. 
My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was of a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long-ncgiccted and yet w'eedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. 
They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegateti shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The Tims Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons. 

‘The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the caning very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly- 
clad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, 
I, dressed in dingy nineteenth -century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded bv an eddvinn mass of bright, soft-coloured robes and 
32 
THE TIME MACHINE 
shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech. 

‘The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not plates nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt slabs — blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways. 
Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recog- 
nized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, 
but for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part they were strange. 

‘Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon these my conductors seated themselves, 
signing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me to do likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands, 
flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loth to follow their example, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure. 

‘And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. The stained-glass windows, which dis- 
played only a geometrical pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught ray eye that the comer of the marble table near me was fractured. Never- 
theless, the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. 
There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same soft, and yet strong, silky material. 

‘Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people ol 
IN THE GOLDEN AGE 33 

the remote future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, 
cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was there— a floury thing in a three-sided husk — was especially good, and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later 1 began to perceive their import. 

‘However, I am telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soon as my appetite v/as a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding cue of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable diflicuUy in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain their business at great length to each other, and ray first attempts to make their exquisite little sounds of the language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command; 
and then 1 got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’ But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, 
so I determined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. Aud very little doses I found they were before long, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I never met people more indolent or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more easily fatigued. 
6 

THE SUNSET OF MANKIND 

*A QUEER thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, 
and that was their lack of interest. They would conic to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but, 
like children, they would soon stop examining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through the portal into the sunlit world again so soon as my hunger was satisfied. 
I was continually meeting more of these men of the future, 
who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own devices. 

‘The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were very confusing. 
Everything was so entirely different from the world I had known — even the flowers. The big building I had left was situate on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, 
perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, a.d. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that, I should explain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded. 

‘As I walked I was watchful for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ruinous it was. 
A little way up the hill, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, was a great heap 
THE SUNSET OF MANKIND 35 

of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumbled heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants 
— nettles possibly — but wonderfully tinted with brown about llie leaves, and incapable of stinging, it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience 
— the first intimation of a still stranger discovery — but of that I will speak in its proper place. 

‘ Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on \^hich I rested for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt awhile, I realized that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently, the single house, 
and possibly even the household, had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared. 

‘'‘Communism,” said I to myself. 

‘And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that ail had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, 
perhaps, that 1 had not noticed this before. But every- 
thing was so strange. Now, 1 saw the fact plainly enough. 
In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged then that the childien of that time were extremely pre- 
cocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion. 

‘ Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the strength of a man and the softness of a w oman, the institution of the family, 
36 THE TIME MACHINE 

and the differeotiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population is balanced and abundant, much child-bearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State: where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, there is less necessity — indeed there is no necessity — of an efficient family, and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children’s needs disappears. We see some begin- 
nings of this even in our onna time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality. 

‘While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed thd thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time. 
With a strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest. 

‘There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize, corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half-smothered in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and 1 surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a view as 1 have ever seen. The sun had aheady gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, 
touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. 
Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and. there came the sharp vertical line of 
THE SUNSET OF MANKIND 37 

some cupola or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden. 

‘So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I bad seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way. 
(Afterwards I found I had got only a half truth — or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt only a glimpse of one facet of the truth): 

‘It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The ruddy sunset set me tMnking of the sunset of mankind. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the hrst time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need: 
security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life — the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure — had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had followed another. Tilings that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in band and carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw! 

‘After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day. 
are still in the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and animals — and how few they are — gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this 
38 THE TIME MACHINE 

will be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. 
In the end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs. 

‘This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well: done indeed for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all lime, in the space of Time across which my machine had leapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fungi; everyw'here were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butter- 
flies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. 
1 saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt la'ter that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes. 

‘Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw man- 
kind housed in splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet 1 had found them engaged in no toil. There were flo signs of struggle, neither social nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt economical struggle. 
The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase. 

‘But with this change in condition come inevitably adaptations to the change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause of human intelligence and 
\igour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the institution of the family, and the

■motions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tender- 
ness for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young. Naw, where are these imminent dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life. 

‘ I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. 
For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions. 

‘Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless energy, that with us is strength, 
would become weakness. Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the love of battle, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, are no great help — may even be hindrances — to a civilized man. And in a state of physical' 
balance and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, 
would be out of place. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, 
are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the strong would be fretted by an energy for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt which there was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived — the flourish of that triumph which began the

THE TIME MACHINE 
last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and decay. 

‘Even this artistic impetus would at last die away — had almost died in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight; so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last! 

‘As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world — ^mastered the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible enough — as most wrong theories are! 
7 

A SUDDEN SHOCK 

‘As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could sleep. 

‘ I looked for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the figure of the While Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. 
There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in 
A SUDDEN SHOCK 
41 
the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. 
“No,” said I stoutly to myself, “that was not the lawn.” 

‘But it was the lawn. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it. Can you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to me? But you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cannot. The Time Machine was gone! 

‘At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a passion of fear, and running with great leaping strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in staunching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, 
with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself, “They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.” Never- 
theless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn, two miles, 
perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. 
[ cursed aloud, as 1 ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, 
and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world. 

‘ When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. 
Not a trace of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty space, among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above mo towered thfe sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, 
42 
THE TIME MACHINE 
in the light of 'the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay. 

‘I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me, 
had I not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, of one thing I felt assured ; 
unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate, 
the machine could not have moved in time. The attach- 
ment of the levers — I will show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the method later- 
prevented any one from tampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved, and was hid, 
only in space. But then, where could it be? 

‘ I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and starth'ng some white animal that, 
in the dim light, I took for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a small deer. I remember, too, 
late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched fists until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. 1 lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you. 

‘There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, 
upon which, perhaps, a score or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt they had forgotten about matches. 
“Where is my Time Machine?” I began, bawling like an 
^gry child, laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to them. 
Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. 
A SUDDEN SHOCK 
43 
When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the' sensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be forgotten. 

‘Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon crept up the sky. 1 suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cm off from my own kind— a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. 1 have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that ; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; 
at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx, and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. 
1 had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm. 

‘1 sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable day- 
light, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face, 
1 saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself. Suppose the worst? I said. Suppose the machine altogether lost — perhaps destroyed? It be- 
hoves me to be calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end, 
perhaps, I may make another. That would be my only 
44 THE TIME MACHINE 

hope, a poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, 
after all, it was a beautiful and curious world. 

‘But probably the machine had only been taken away. 
Still, I must be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cunning. And with that 1 scrambled to my feet and looked about me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The fresh- 
ness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. 
I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn. 1 wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures: some were simply stolid; some thought it was a jest, and laughed at me. 1 had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. 
It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed, and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. 
I found a groove ripped iu it, about midway between the 
. pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine. 
There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those 1 could imagine made by a sloth. 
This directed my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, 
as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, 
but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow. E xaminin g the panels W'ith care I found them discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were doors as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enou^ to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that pedestal. 
But how it got there was a different problem. 
A SUDDEN SHOCK 
45 
‘I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom-covered apple- 
trees towards me. I turned smiling to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, f tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. 
I don’t know how to convey their expression to you. Sup- 
pose you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman — it is how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. 
I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, 1 wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, 
like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was nfter him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go. 

‘But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels, I thought I heard something stir inside 
—to be explicit, I thought 1 heard a sound like a chuckle, 
— but I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, 
I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a long vigil. I could work at a problem for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt years, but to wait inactive for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt twenty- 
four hours — that is another matter. 

‘I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again. “Patience,” 
said I to myself “If you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt want your machine again you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 
46 THE TIME MACHINE 

must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take your machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels, and if they don’t, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will get it back as soon as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can ask for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it. To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies mono- 
mania. Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will find clues to it all.” Then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and the most hope- 
less trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud. 

"Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people avoided me. It may have bten my fancy, 
or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet 1 felt tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern, 
and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language, and, in addition, 
1 pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt their language was excessively simple 
— almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt little use of figurative language. Their sentenees were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt understand any but the simplest propositions. 1 deter- 
mined to put the thought of my Time Machine, and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. 
Yet a certain feeling, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.

EXPLANATION 

‘So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendid buildings, 
endlessly varied in material and style; the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there w'ater shone like silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One Jay by the path up the hill, which 1 had followed during my first walk. Like the others, it w'as rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud— thud — thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, 
that a steady current of air set down the shafts. Further, 
I threw a .scrap of paper into the throat of one; and, 
instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight. 

‘After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes; for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. 
Putting things together, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of 
48 
THE TIME MACHINE 
these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong. / 

‘And here 1 must admit that I learned very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance, and the like con- 
veniences, during my time in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is con- 
tained in one’s imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Con- 
ceive the talc of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet wc, at least, 
should be willing enough to exjtlain these things to him! 
And even of what he knew, hov/ much could he make his rntravelled friend either apprehend or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt believe? Then, 
think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but, save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a general impression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very little of the difference to your mind. 

‘In the matter of sepulture, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, I could see no signs of crematoria nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that, possibly, there might be cemeteries 
(or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none. 

‘ I must confess that mv satisfaction with mv first theories 
of an automatic civiliziition and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my diflSculties. Tlie several big palaces I had explored 
■were mere living places, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. 1 could find no machinery, no appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metal-work. 
Somehow such things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things were kept going. 

‘Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, 

I knew not what, had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt— how shall I put itV Suppose you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt found an inscription, with sentences here and there in excellent plain English, and, interpolated therewith, others tnade up of words, of letters even, abso- ' 
lutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me! 

‘That day, too, I made a friend— of a sort. It happened that, as I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp, and began drifting down stream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt even a moderate swimmer. 
It will give you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly-crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in 
50 THE TIME MACHINE 

at a point lower down, I caught the poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mite, and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. 
In that, however, I was wrong. 

‘This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration: and she received me with cries of delight, and presented me with a big garland of flowers — evidently made for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate. At any rate 1 did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected me exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did . the same to hers. 
When I tried talk, and found that her name was Weena. 
which, though I don’t know what it meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a w'cek, and ended — as I wilt 
‘ tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ! 

‘She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think altogether I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion. 
Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. 
I thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know what 
EXPLANATION 
51 
I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt until it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. 
For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; 
and 1 would watch for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill. 

‘It was from her, too, that 1 learnt that fear had not yet left the world. She was fearless enough in the day- 
light, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt once, 
in a foolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, 
and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the dark, 
dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and U set me thinking and observing. I dis- 
covered, then, among other things, that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt one sleeping alone witliin doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and, in spite of Weena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes. 

‘ It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me triumphed, and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt five of the nights of our acquain- 
tance, including the last uight of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, 
and that sea-anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless 
52 THE TIME MACHINE 

and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things arc just creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flag- 
stones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise. 

‘The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half- 
light. The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times, as 1 scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved hastily. 
I did not see what became of them. It see’med that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, 
you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, 
early-morning feeling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may have known. I doubted my eyes. 

‘As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the 
.day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my wliitc figures. They were mere creatures of the half-light. “They must have been ghosts,” I said; 
“I wonder whence they dated.” For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the morning, until Wcena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my first passionate search for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Time Machine. But

Wccna was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind. 

‘I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this Golden Age. I cannot account for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it. It may be that the sun was hotter, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it. 

‘Well, one’ very hot morning — ^my fourth, I think— as 1 was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. 
By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. 1 entered it groping, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, 
luminous by reflection apinst the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness. 

‘The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. 1 clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that strange terror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways. 
54 THE TIME MACHINE 

and something white ran past me, 1 turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry. 

‘My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes ; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all fours, 
or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt only with its fore-arms held very low. After an instant’s 
■pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and. looking down, I saw a small, white moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. 
It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider! 
It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time a number of metal foot- and hand-rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared. 

‘I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. 
It was not for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was hu man. But, gradually the truth dawned on me: that Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct animals: 
that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me. was also heir to all the aaes. 
EXPLANATION 
55 
‘I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organization? 
How was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the solution of my difficulties. 
And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, 
two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight into the shadow. 
The male pursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran. 

‘They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures; for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt when I pointed to this one, and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly dis- 
tressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Wcena, and sec what I could get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a due to the import of these wells, to the ventilating towers, 
to the mystery of the ghosts: to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me. 

‘Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued 
56 
THE TIME MACHINE 
underground habit. In the first place, there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark — ^the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance. Then, those large eyes, with that capacity for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things — witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, 
that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling and awkward flight tbwards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light — all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina. 

‘Beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of ventilating-shafts and wells along the hill slopes— everywhere, in fact, except along the river valley — showed how universal were its famifications. 
What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that 1 at once accepted it, and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species. 
I dare say you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will anticipate the shape of my theory, 
though, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth. 

‘At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt — and wildly incredible! — and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utilize underground space for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the less ornamental purposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are under- 
ground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and 
EXPLANATION 
37 
multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky. 

I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing 

amount of its time therein, till, in the end 1 Even 

now, does not an East-end worker live in such artiflda! 
conditions as practically to be cut off from the luitaral surface of the earth? 

‘Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people — due, 
no doubt, to the increasing refinement of their education, 
and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt — ^is already leading to the closing, in ibeir interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf— which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich — will make that exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and' 
comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots; 
the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would, no doubt, have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the ven- 
tilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt be suffocated for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt arrears. Such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of under-ground life, and as happy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, 
the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt followed naturally enough. 
58 THE TIME MACHINE 

‘The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature, but a triumph over nature and the fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced civilization that was at last attained roust have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size; strength, and intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. 
What had happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I had seen of the Morlocks — that, 
by the by, was the name by which these creatures were called — I could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the “Eloi,” 
the beautiful race that I already knew. 

‘ Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine? For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I felt sure it w'as they vlho had taken it. Why, ton, if the Eloi were masters, 
could they not restore the machine to me? And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said, to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was disappointed. At first she would not under- 
stand my questions, and presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. 
And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, 
I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them 1 ceased abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only 
THE MORLOCKS 
59 
concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while 1 solemnly burnt a match. 
9 

THE MORLOCKS 

‘It may seem odd to you, but it was two day.s before I could follow up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the E’oi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate. 

‘The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. I was oppressed with per- 
plexity and doubt. Once or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt twice I had a feeling of intense fear for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt which I could perceive no definite reason. 
J remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight — that night Weena was among them — and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me, even then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter, 
and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of those unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, 
this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. 1 felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horribly alone. 
CO THE TIME MACHINE 

tad even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. I don’t know if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will understand my feding, but I never felt quite safe at my back. 

'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me further and further afield in my exploring expedi- 
tions. Going to the south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ruins I knew, and the fagade bad an Oriental look; 
the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and 1 was minded to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come hpon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to bold over the adventure for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. 
But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium. 

‘Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted. “Good- 
bye, little Weena,” I said, kissing her; and then, putting her down., I began to feel over the parapet for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and, 
running to me, began to pull at me with her little hands. 
I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I 
THB MORLOCKS 
61 
shook her perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in the t^oat of the well. I saw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung. 

‘ I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself. I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience 1 did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible.- Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible, w'hile little Weena’s head showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when 1 looked up again Weena had disappeared. 

‘ I was in an agony of discomfort. 1 had some thought of trying to go up the shaft Sgain, and leave the Under- 
world alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense relief, 
I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which 1 could lie down and rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, 
my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the pro- 
longed terror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb-and-hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft. 
62 THE TIME MACHINE 

*I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I saw three stoojang while creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impene- 
trable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. 
But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, 
they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion. 

‘1 tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from that of the overworld people; 
so that 1 was needs left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself^, “you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are in for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it now,” and, 
feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and 1 came to a large open space, and, striking another match, saw that 1 had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness "beyond the range of my light. 
The view 1 had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match. 

‘Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Moriocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. 
The Moriocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have 
THE MORLOCKS 
63 
survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung ray fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness. 

‘I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt such an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke — at times I missed tobacco frightfully! — even without enough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed tliat glimpse of the Underworld in a second, 
and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers that Ngture had endowed me with — hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety matches that still remained to me. 

‘ I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and 1 was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescrib- 
ably unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly 
64 THE TIME MACHINE 

as 1 could. They started away, and then 1 could feci them approaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently, and shouted again — rather discordantly. This time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. 
I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out, and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, 
as they hurried after me. 

‘In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked — those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, 
pinkish -grey eyes!— as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, 1 promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the projecting hooks, and, 
as I did so, ray feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match . . . and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, 1 disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy. 

‘That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. 
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME 
65 
I had the greatest diflSculty in keeping ray hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. 
Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the we!l-raoulh somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. E\'en tbe soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, 
for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time, I was insensible. 
10 

WHEN THE NIGHT CAME 

‘Now, indeed,' I seemed in a worse case than before. 
Hitherto, except during tny night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustainitig hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown fojces which I had only to imderstand to over- 
come; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks— a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it. Now 1 felt like a beast in a trap, w'hose enemy vrould come upon him soon. 

‘The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very ditlicult problem 1.0 guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the w'ane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight 
66 THE TIME MACHINE 

degree at least the reason of the fear of the little upper- 
world people for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The upper-world people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants; but that had long since passed away. 
The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovignian kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. 
They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Mor- 
locks, subterranean for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt innumerable generations, had come at last to find tlic day-lit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had im- 
pressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coining back — changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming re- 
acquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the under- 
world. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, 
but coming in almost like a question from outside. 
I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not Itell what it was at the time, 

‘ Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. 
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME 67 

I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without further delay 1 determined to make myself arms and a fastness where 1 might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realizing to what creatures night by night 
] lay exposed. 1 felt 1 could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to think how they must already have examined me. 

‘1 wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. /VII the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, *to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; 
and in the evening, taking Weena like a child upon my shouldef, 1 went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist atternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole — they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors— so that 1 was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky. 

‘Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a time she desired me to let her down, 
and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting ofl' 
on cither hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt floral decoration. At least she utilized them for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that 
68 THB TIMB MACHINB 

purpose. And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...’ 

The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, 
and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative. 

‘As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone. But L pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear’ remote, and empty save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset. 
Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preter* 
naturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, iudeed, 
almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the dark. In my excite- 
ment I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows us a declaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine? 

‘ So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. Tlie clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. V'eena’s fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed hOT face against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness 1 almost walked into a little river. This 1 waded, and went up the opposite 
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME 69 

side of the valley, past a number of sleeping-houses, and by a statue — a Faun, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some such figure, minus the head. 
Here, too, were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come. 

‘From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me. I hesitated at this. 
1 could see no end to it, cither to the right or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the left. 
Feeling tired — my feet in particular were very sore — I care- 
fully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. 
1 looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would be' out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking danger — a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon — there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree boles to strike against. 
I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; 
so 1 decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill. 

‘Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the moonrise. The hill-side was quiet and deserted, 
but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human hfetimes, had long since re-arranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star -dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me: it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these 
70 THE TIME MACHINE 

scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend. 

‘Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future. 1 thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organizations, 
the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which 1 went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that w^as between the two species, and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time, 
with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Y’et it was too horrible! 
] looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought. 

‘Through that long night 1 held my mind oflT the Morlocks as well as I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a hazy cloud or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so. No doubt 1 dozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless tire, and the old moon rose, 
thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and over- 
taking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, 
and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the 
71 
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME 

ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, 
took off my shoes, and flung them away. 

‘I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, 
now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding. 
We found some fruit wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. And then 1 thought once more of the meat that I had seen. T felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some lime in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such- 
like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was— far less than anv monkey. His* prejudice against human flesh is no deep- 

seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men ! 

I tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt four thousand years ago. 
And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? 
These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon — probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side! 

‘Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that was coming upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punish- 
ment of human selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, 
had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fulness of time Necessity bad come home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy- 
in- decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. How - 
ever great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form hot to claim my sympathy, 
72 
THE TIME MACHINE 
and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear. 

'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt stone as I could contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nothing, I knew, would be more eflScient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. 
I had in mind a battering-ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter these doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. 
I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Weena 1 had resolved ,to bring with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling. 
11 

THE PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN 

‘I FOUND the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted and falling into ruin. 
Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt even creek, 
where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then — though I never followed up the thought — of what might have happened, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt might be happening, to the living things in the sea. 
THE PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN 73 
‘The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thouglit, rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, 
but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, 
more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human. 

‘Within the big valves of the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt — which were open and broken — ^we found, instead of the customary hall, 
a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was. clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. 
I recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a Bronto- 
saurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and, clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have been air-tight, to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents. 

‘Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeonto- 
logical Section, and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety -nine hundredths of its force, was, nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. 
74 THE TIME MACHINE 

Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances been bodily removed — by the Morlocks as 1 judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. 
Weena, who had been rolling a sea-urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as f stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me. 

‘And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented. Even my pre-occupation about the Time Machine receded a little from my mind. 

‘To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be, 
even a library! To me, at least in my present circum- 
stances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the first. 
This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gun-pow^der. 
But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. 
As for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the rest of the contents of that gallery, though, on the whole, they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everj^thing had long since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants; that was all! I was sorry for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that, 
because I should have been glad to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature 
THE PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN 75 

had been attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling 
— many of them cracked and smashed — which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my element, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. 
you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know I have a certain weakness for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these: the more so as for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and 1 could make only the vaguest guesses at v/hat they were for. 
1 fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks. * 

‘Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me. Had it not been for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the gallery sloped at all.^ The end I had come in at was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt went down the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the “area” 
of a London house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions drew my. attention. Then I sav/ that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, 
and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away to- 
wards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt that I was 

^ It may be, of course, that the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did not slope, but that the museum was built into the side of a hill. — E d. 
7C 
THE TIME MACHINE 
wastiag my time in this academic examination of machinery. 
I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a lire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well. 

‘ I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, 
I left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and 'grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Wcena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it snapped after a minute’s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt any Morlock skull I miglit encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so. Very inhuman, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may think, to want to go killing one’s own descendants ! But it was impossible, 
somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Wcena, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the galley and killing the brutes 1 heard. 

‘Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, 1 went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one, 
which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. 
But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. 
THE PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN 77 

At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics. 

‘Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here 1 had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. 
And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. “Dance,” I cried to her in her own tongue. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures wc feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly pcrf6rmcd a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. 
For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I am naturally inventive, as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know. 

‘Now, I still think that for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt immemorial years was a most strange, as for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me it was a most fortunate, thing. Yet, 
oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that wai camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, 
I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. 1 fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass acci:>rdingly. But the odour of camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was unmistakable. 
In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. 
It reminded me of a sepia painting 1 had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnitc that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago. 1 w^as about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame — was, in fact, an excellent candle — and I put it in my pocket. I found no 
78 
THE TIME MACHINE 
explosives, however, nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless 1 left that gallery greatly elated. 

‘1 cannot tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all the story of that long afternoon. 
It would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. 1 remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how 1 hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron projnised best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, 
but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. 
But any cartridges or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered: perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols— 
Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy. 

‘As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, 
the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, 
sometimes fresher. In one place 1 suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the merest accident 1 discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! 1 shouted “Eureka!” and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, 
selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. 1 never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, 
fifteen minutes for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ^n explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. 1 really believe that, had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown

79 
Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) iny chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence. 

‘ It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. To- 
wards sunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. 
I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks— I had matches! 
I had the camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. 
But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the work.

IN THE DARKNESS 

‘Ws emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. I w^as determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the w^oods that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a lire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt dried grass I sav/, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, 
80 THE TIME MACHINE 

our progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena had tired. And I, also, began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of imj^ending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been without sleep for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. 1 felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it. 

‘While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, 
and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figuies. There was scrub and long grass all about us, 
and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. 
The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across. 
If we could get through it to the bare hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place: 
I thought that with my matches and my camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the v.'oods. 
Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood: so, 
rather reluctanil}', I put it down. And then it came into roy head that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, 
but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt covering our retreat. 

‘1 don’t know if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a tem- 
perate climate. The sun’s heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is some- 
times the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to wide-spread lire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. 
In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking 
IN THE DARKNESS 81 

up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Weena. 

‘ She wanted to run lo it and play with it. I believe she would have cast herself into it had I not restrained her. 
But I caught her up, and, in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread lo some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. 
I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, 
but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me to avoid the stems. Over- 
head it was simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone. down upon us here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hands free. Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right band I had my iron bar. 

‘For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my cars. Then 1 seemed to know of a pattering about me. 
I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sounds and voices I had heard in the under-world. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, 
in another minute I fdt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still, 

‘It was lime for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a match. But to get one I must put her dowm. I did so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, 
a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, toucliing even my neck. . Then the 
82 
THE TIME MACHINE 
match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. 
I hastily took a lump of camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. 
Then I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. 
The wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company! 

‘She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, 1 had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. T determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena, 
still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, 
as my first lump of camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes shone like carbuncles. 

‘The camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt flickered and went out. I lit a match, 
and as I did so, two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay, 
staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, 
no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging 
IN THE DARKNESS 
83 
down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my camphor. Then 1 turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. 1 tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt not she breathed. 

‘Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was in the air. My fire would not need replenishing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an hour or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so. 1 felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that 1 did not understand. 
1 seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, 
and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers 1 hastily felt in my pocket for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the match-box, and -it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had happened. 1 had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. 1 was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. 
It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feci all these soft creatures heaped upon me. 1 felt as if I was in a monstrous spider’s w'eb. I w'as overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as 1 did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where 1 judged their faces might be. 1 could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, 
and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment I was free. 

‘The strange exultation that so often seems to accom- 
pany hard fighting came upon me. 1 knew that both I and Weena were lost, but 1 determined to make the Mor- 
locks pay for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt their meat. 1 stood with my back to a tree, 
swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was 
14 
THE TIME MACHINE 
full of the Stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. 
I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me — three battered at my feet — and then I recognized, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood agape, 
1 saw a Uttle red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I under- 
stood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight. 

‘Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, 
I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt reflection. My iron bar still gripped, 1 followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran, that I was outflanked, and had to strike ofi' to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as 1 did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire! 

‘And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, 
I think, of all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire. 
In the centre was a hillock or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from 
IN THE DARKNESS 85 

it, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. 
Upon the hill-side were some thirty or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt forty Morlocks, 
dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, 
I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no more of them. 

‘Yet every now and then one would come straight to- 
wards me, setting loose a quivering horror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that made me quick to elude him. At one time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to sed me. I was even thinking of beginning the tight by killing some of them before this should happen; 
but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. 
1 w'alkcd about the hUl among them and avoided them, 
looking for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some trace of Weena. But Wcena was gone. 

‘At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises lo each one, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so. 

‘For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. 1 bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to aw^ake. I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sai down again, and wandered here and there, 
and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and 
86 THE TIME MACHINE 

rush into the flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day. 

^ I searched again for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain that they had left her poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt little body in the forest. 1 cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, 
but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the White Sphinx. And so, leavings the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, 
as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely again — terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain. 

‘But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost. 
13 

THE TRAP OF THE WHITE SPHINX 

‘About eight or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening, and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my contidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of tlie beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees. 
Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. 
And like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the under-world. I understood now what all the beauty of the over -world people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies, and provided against no needs. And their end was the same. 

‘I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes — to come to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. 
The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed. 

‘It is a law of nature we o\erlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt change, danger, and 
88 THE TIME MACHINE 

trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environ- 
ment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of iutelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers. 

‘ So, as I see it, the upper-world man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and the under-world to mere mechanical industry. But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mechanical perfection— absolute per- 
manency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding of the under-world, however it was effected, had become dis- 
jointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The under-world being in contact with machinery, 
which, liowever perfect, still needs some little thought out- 
side habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human character, than the upper. And when other meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent.. It ia bow the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I give it to you. 

‘After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and refreshing sleep. 

‘ I awoke a little before sunsetting, I now felt safe against being caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towards the White Sphinx. 
I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket. 
THE TRAP OF THE WHITE SPHINX 89 

*And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into grooves. 

‘At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter. 

‘Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the comer of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaborate preparations for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry not to use it. 

‘A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose. 

‘Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark — ^trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully. 

‘1 could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. 
I had only to fix on the levers and depart like a ghost. 
But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Ihen I liad simply to fight against their persistent fingers for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my levers, and at the same time feel for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost got away from me. 
?0 
THE TIME MACHINE 
As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark with my bead — I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring — to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble. 

‘But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described. 
14 

THE FURTHER VISION 

*I HAVE already told you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling. And this iirae I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, aud when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers I had pulled them over so as to go for- 
ward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators i found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch — into futurity. 

‘As T drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appear- 
ance of things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; 
then — ^though I was still travelling with prodigious velocity 
— the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, 
until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last a 
THE FURTHER VISION 91 

Steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the sun had ceased to set — it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished . 
The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red -heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, 
for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I remembered my former headlong fall, 1 began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless, and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible, 

"I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine^ 
looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North- 
eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, 
lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt on the lichen in caves : plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight 
92 THE TIME MACHINE 

*Th« machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea 
■tfetched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horixon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. 
And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt — pink under the lurid sky. 
There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now. 

‘Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, 
and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antenne, like carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could sec the many palps of its com- 
plicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved. 

‘As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards miii, I felt a tickling on my check as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught something thread- 
like. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a frightful qualm,.! turned, and saw that I had grasped the 
THE FURTHER VISION 93 

uiteana of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, 
smeared with an algal slime, were descending upon me. 
In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green. 

‘ I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous- 
looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one’s lubgs; ail contributed to an appalling eifect. 
I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun — a little larger, a little duller — the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy Crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward sky I saw a curved pale hne like a vast new moon. 

‘ So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand years or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate, watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once more, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the crawling multitude of crabs hud disappeared, and the red beach, 
save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed life- 
less. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I could see an 
94 THE TIME MACHINE 

undulating crest of hillocks pinkish-white. There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses 1‘urther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen. 

‘I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, 
in earth or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sky or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow sand- 
bank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as 1 looked at it, and 1 judged that my eye had been deceived, and that 
' the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle veiy little. 

‘Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. 1 saw^ this grow larger. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute perhaps 1 stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that an eclipse w'as beginning. Either the moon or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the planet Mercury was passing across the sun’s disk. Naturally, at first 1 took it to be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth. 

‘The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It w^ould be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, 
the stir that makes the background of our lives — all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold 
THE TIME TRAVELLER’S RETURN 
95 
of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. Tn another moment the pale stars alone were visible. 
All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black. 

‘A horror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of this great darkness came on me. The cold, 
that smote to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. 
Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal — there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing — against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping litfully about. Then I felt 1 was fainting. 
But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle. 
15 

THE TIME TRAVELLER’S RETURN 

‘So I came back. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The blinking succession of the days' and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, 
the sky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent 
96 the time machine 

humanity. These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize our own petty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower. 
Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. 
Very gently now, I slowed the mechanism down. 

‘I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that when 1 set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Walchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones. 
The door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt at the lower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt by which she had previously entered. Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment; but he passed like a flash. 

‘Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt several minutes 1 trembled violently. Then 1 became calmer. Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have^ 
slept there, and the whole thing have been a dream. 

‘And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of the laboratoiy. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall where you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw it. That gives you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into w hich the Morlocks had carried my machine. 

‘For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. 

I saw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I

97 
found the date was indeed to-day, and looking at the time- 
piece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated — I felt so sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt on you. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know the rest. I washed, 
and dined, and now I am telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the story.’ 
16 

AFTER THE STORY 

"I KNOW,’ he said, after a pause, ‘that all this will be absolutely incredible to you, hut lo me the one incredible thing is that ham here to-night in this old familiar room, 
looking into your friendly faces, and telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all these strange adventures.’ He looked at the (Vicdical Man. 
‘No. 1 cannot expect you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to believe it. Take it as a lie 
— or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a prophecy. Say 1 dreamed it in the workshop. 
Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our race, until 1 have batched inis fiction. Treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking it as a story, what do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think of it?’ 

He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary stiiine&s. Then chaii’s began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host. The Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was looking hard at the end of his cigar— the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his watch. The others, as far as I remember, were motionless. 
98 THE TIME MACHINE 

The Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt stood up with a sigh. ‘What a pity it is you’re not a writer of stories!’ he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s shoulder. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t believe it?’ 

‘Well ’ 

‘ I thought not.’ 

The Time Traveller turned to us. ‘Where are the matches?’ he said. He lit one and spoke over his pipe, 
puffing. ‘To tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the truth ... I hardly believe it myself. . . . And yet ... ’ 

His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and 1 saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles. 

The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. ‘The gynasceum’s odd,’ he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see, holding out his hand for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a specimen. 

‘ I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. 
‘How shall we get home?’ 

‘Plenty of cabs at the station,’ said the Psychologist. 

‘It’s a curious thing,’ said the Medical Man; ‘but I certainly don’t know the natural order of these flowers. 
‘May I have them?’ 

The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly, ‘Cer- 
tainly not.’ 

‘Where did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt really get them?’ said the Medical Man. 

The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. ‘They were put into my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.’ He stared round the room. ‘I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and the atmosphere of every day is too much for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my memory. 
Did I ever make a Time Machine, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a model of a Time Machine? or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt is it all only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt dream at times — but I can’t stand 
AFTER THE STORY 
99 
another that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If there is one!’ 

He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, 
through the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt into the corridor. We followed him. 
There in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of brass, 
ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the touch — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I put out my hand and felt the rail of it — 
and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry. 

The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, 
and ran his hand along the damaged rail. ‘It’s all right now,’ he said. ‘The story I told you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was true. I’m sorry to have brought you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt out here in the cold.’ He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room. 

He came into the hall with us, and helped the Editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt on with his coat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he w'as sufl'ering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. 1 remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good night. 

I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 
‘gaudy lie.’ For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day, and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute at the Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat substantial- 
looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. 
Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer 
100 THE TIME MACHINE 

reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be for- 
bidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor*. 
The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. ‘I’m frightfully busy,’ said he, ‘with that thing in there.’ 

‘But is it not some hotu?’ 1 said. ‘Do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt really travel through time?’ 

‘Really and truly I do.’ And be looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 
‘I only want half an hour,’ he said. ‘I know why you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s some maga- 
zines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this time travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll for- 
give my leaving you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt now?’ 

I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and he nodded and went on dov/n the corridor. 
1 heard the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly 1 was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the Time Traveller. 

As I took hold of the handle of the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I heard an exclamation, oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. 
I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment — a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distiuct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a su’osiding stir of dust, the further end 
EPILOGUE 
101 
of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, 
apparently, just been blown in. 

I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that some- 
thing strange had happened, and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As I stood staring, the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt into the garden opened, and the man- 
servant appeared. 

We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 
‘Has Mr. gone out that way?’ said I. 

‘No, sir. No one has come out this way. 1 was expecting to find him here.’ 

At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson, I stayed on, waiting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Time Traveller: 
waiting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him. 
But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a life- 
time. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, 
as everybody knows now, he has never returned. 
EPILOGUE 

One cannot choose but wonder. WiU he ever return? 
It may be that he swept back into the past, and fell among the blood -drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now — if I may use the phrase 
— be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunlcd Oolitic coral reef, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. 
or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary 
102 THE TIME MACHINE 

theory, and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part. He, I know — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made — thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a fooJisli heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt us to live as though it were not so. 
But to me the future is still black and blank — is a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ray comfort, two strange white flowers — shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle — ^to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man. 
THE STOLEN BACILLUS 
*This again,’ said tlie Bacieriologist, slipping a glass slide under the microscope, ‘is a preparation of the celebrated Bacillus of cholera — the cholera germ.’ 

The pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not accustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his disengaged eye. H see very little,’ he said. 

‘Touch this screw,’ said the Bacteriologist; ‘perhaps the microscope is out of focus for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt you. Eyes vary so much. 
Just the fraction of a turn this way or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that.’ 

‘Ah! now I see,’ said the visitor. ‘Not so very much to see, after all. . Little streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those mere atomies, might multiply and devastate a city 1 Wonderful 1 * 

He stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it in his hand towards the window. 
‘Scarely visible,’ he said, scrutinizing the preparation. 
He hesitated. ‘Are these—alive? Are they dangerous now?’ 

‘Those have been stained and killed,’ said the Bac- 
teriologist. ‘ I wish, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the universe.’ 

‘I suppose,’ the pale man said with a slight smile, ‘that you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt scarcely care to have such things about you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in the living — in the active state?’ 

‘On the contrary, we are obliged to,’ said the Bac- 
teriologist. ‘Here, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance ’ He walked across 

the room and took up one of several sealed tubes. ‘Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the actual living disease bacteria.’ He hesitated. ‘Bottled cholera, so to speak.’ 

A slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in 
104 THE STOLEN BACILLUS 

the face of the pale man. ‘It's a deadly thing to have in your possession,’ he said, devouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the morbid pleasure in his visitor’s expression. This man, who had visited him that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend, interested him from the very contrast of their dis- 
positions. The lank black hair and deep grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous manner, the fitful yet keen interest of his visitor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were a novel change from the phleg- 
matic deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the Bacteriologist chiefly associated. It was perhaps natural, with a hearer evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of his topic, to take the most efiectivc aspect of the matter. 

He held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. ‘Yes, here is the pestilence imprisoned. Only break suph a little tube as this into a supply of drinking water, say to these minute particles of life that one must needs stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see, and that one can neither smell nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt taste — say to them, “Go forth, 
increase and multiply, and replenish the cisterns,” and death — mysterious, untraceabie death, death swift and terrible, death full of pain and indignity— would be released upon this city, and go hither and thither seeking his victims. 
Here he would take the- husband from the wife, here the child from its mother, here the statesman from his duty, 
and here the toiler from his trouble. He would follow the water-mains, creeping along streets, picking out and punishing a house hcic and a house there where they did not boil their drinking-water, creeping into the wells of the mineral-water makers, getting washed into salad, and lying dormant in ices. He would wait ready to be drunk in the horse-troughs, and by unwary children in the public fountains. He would soak into the soil, to reappear in springs and wells, at a thousand unexpected places. Once start him at the water supply, and before we could ring 
THE STOLEN BACILLUS 105 

him in, and catch him again, he would have decimated the metropolis.’ 

He stopped abruptly. He had been told rhetoric was his weakness. 

‘But he is quite safe here, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know— quite safe.’ 

The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. ‘These Anarchist— rascals,’ said he, 
‘are fools, blind fools— to use bombs when this kind of thing is attainable. I think ’ 

A gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails was heard at the door. The Bacteriologist opened it. ‘Just a minute, dear,’ whispered his wife. 

When he re-entered the laboratory his visitor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was looking at his watch. ‘ I had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time,’ he said. ‘Twelve minutes to four \ ought to have left here by li^lf-past three. But your things were really too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer. I have an engagement at four.’ 

He passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist accompanied Iiim to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the passage to his laboratory. 
He was musing on the ethnology of his visitor. Certainly the man was not a Teutonic type nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a common Latin one. 
‘A morbid product, anyhow, I am afraid,’ said the Bacteri- 
ologist to himself. ‘How he gloated on those cultivations of disease-germs!’ A disturbing thought struck him. He turned to the bench by the vapour -bath, and then very quickly to his writing-table. Then he felt hastily in his pockets, and then ruslicd to the door. ‘ 1 Loay have put it down on the hail table,’ he said. 

‘Minnie!’ he shouted hoarsely in the hall. 

‘Yes, dear,’ came a remote voice. 

‘Had I anything in my hand when I spoke to you, dear, 
just now?’ 

Pause. 

‘Nothing, dear, because 1 remember * 
106 THE STOLEN BACILLUS 

‘Blue ruin!’ cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the front door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and down the steps of his house to the street. 

Minnie, hearing the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt slam violently, ran in alarm to the v/indow. Down the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The Bacteriologist, hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly towards this group. One slipper came oflF, but he did not w^ait for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it. 
‘He has gone madT said Minnie; ‘it’s that horrid science of his’; and, opening the window, would have called after him. The slender man, suddenly glancing round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, 
the apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse s feet clattered, and in a moment cab, and Baciericlogist hotly in pursuit, bad receded up the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner. 

Minnie remained straining out of the window for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute. Then she drew her head back into the room again. 
She was dumbfounded. ‘Of course he is eccentric,’ she meditated. ‘But running about London— in the height of the season, too — in his socks!’ A happy thought struck her. She hastily put her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down bis hat and light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and hailed a cab that opportunely crawled by. " Drive me up the road and round Havelock Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen coat and no hat.’ 

' Velveteen coat, ma’am, and no ’at. Very good, ma’am.’ 
And the cabman whipped up at once in the most mattcr- 
of-fact way, as if he drove to this address every day in his life. 

Some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that collects round the cabmen’s shelter at Haver- 
stock Hill w^ere startled by the passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven furiously. 
THE STOLEN BACILLUS 107 

They were silent as it went by, and then as it receded— 
‘That’s ’Arry Tcks. Wot’s he got?’ said the stout gentle- 
man known as Old Tootles. 

‘He’s a-using his whip, he is, to rights,’ said the ostler boy. 

‘Hullo!’ said poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt old Tommy Bylcs; ‘here’s another bloomin’ loonatic. Blowed if there ain’t.’ 

‘It’s old George,’ said old Tootles, ‘and he’s drivin’ a loonatic, as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say. Ain’t he a-clawin’ out of the keb? 
Wonder if he’s after ’Arry ’Icks?’ 

The group round the cabmen’s shelter became animated. 
Chorus: ‘Go it, George!’ ‘It’s a race.’ ‘You’ll ketch 
’em!’ ‘Whip up!’ 

‘She’s a goer, she is!’ said the ostler boy. 

‘Strike me giddy!’ cried old Tootles. ‘Here! Fm a-goin’ to begki in a minute. Here's another coinin’. If all the kebs in Hampstead ain't gone mad this morning!’ 

‘It’s a fieldmale this time,’ said the ostler boy. 

‘She’s a followin’ him," said old Tootles. ‘Usually the other way about.’ 

‘What’s she got in her ’and?’ 

‘ Looks like a ’igh ’at.’ 

‘What a bloomin’ lark it is! Three to one on old George,’ said the ostler boy. ‘Nexst!’ 

Minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it but she felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock Hill and Camden Town High Street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back view of old George, who was driving her vagrant husband so incomprehensively away from her. 

The man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, 
his arms tightly folded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of destruction gripped in his hand. 
His mood was a singular mixture of fear and exultation. 
Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could accomplish his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer 
108 THE STOLEN BACILLUS 

but larger fear of the awfulness of his crime. But his exultation far exceeded his fear. No Anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his. Ravachol, 
Vaillant, all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied dwindled into insignificance beside him. He had only to make sure of the water supply, and break the little tube into a reservoir. How brilliantly he had planned it, 
forged the letter of introduction and got into the laboratory, 
and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity! The world should hear of him at last. All those people who had sneered at him, neglected him, preferred other people to liim, found his company undesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death, death! They had always treated him as a man of no importance. All the world bad been in a conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it is to isolate a man. ‘What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew’s Street, of course! 
How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The Bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards beliind. That was bad. He would be caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt money, and found half-a-sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into the man’s face. ‘More,’ he shouted, ‘if only we get away.’ 

The money was snatched out of his hand. ‘Right you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are,’ said the cabman, and the trap slanuned, and the lash lay along the glistening side of the horse. The cab swayed, 
and the Anarchist, half-standing under the trap, put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve his balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken half of it rang upon the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the cab. He fell back into the seat with a curse, and stared dismally at the two or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three drops of moisture on the apron. 

He shuddered. 

‘Well! I suppose I shall be the first. Phew! Anyhovi^, 
I shall be a Martyr. That’s something. But it is a filthy 
THE STOLEN BACILLUS 109 

death, nevertheless. I wonder if it hurts as much as they say.’ 

Presently a thought occurred to him — he groped between his feet. A little drop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to make sure. It was better to make suie. At any rate, he would not fail. 

Then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the Bacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got out. He slipped on the step, 
and his head felt queer. It was rapid stuff this cholera poison. He w'aved his cabman out of existence, so to speak, and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon bis breast awaiting the arrival of the Bacteriologist. 
There was something tragic in his pose. The sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He greeted his pursuer wkh a defiant laugh. 

‘Vive rAnarcliie! you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are too late, my friend. I have drunk it. The cholera is abroad! ’ 

The Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his spectacles. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now.’ He was about to say something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the corner of his mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at which the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards Vv^aterloo Bridge, carefully jostliiig his infected body against as many people as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the appearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and overcoat. ‘Very good of you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to bring my things,’ he said, and remained lost in con- 
templation of the receding figure of the Anarchist. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt had better get in,’ he said, still staring, Minnie felt absolutely convinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own responsibility. ‘Put on my shoes? Certainly, dear,’ said he, as the cab began to turn. 
no THE STOLEN BACILLUS 

and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the distance^ 
from his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him, and he laughed. Then he remarked, ‘It is really very serious, though.’ 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist. No — don’t faint, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I cannot possibly tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the rest. And 1 wanted to astonish him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation of that new species of Bacterium I was telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of, 
that infest, and I think cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and like a fool, I said it was Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the water of London, and he certainly might have made things look blue for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this civilized city. And now he has swallowed it. 
Of course, 1 cannot say what will happen, but you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know it turned that kitten blue, and the three puppies — in patches, 
and the sparrow — bright blue. But the bother is, 1 shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some more. 

‘Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs. Jabber. My dear, Mrs. Jabber is not a draught. But why should 1 wear a coat on a hot day because of Mrs. ? Oh! very weU.’ 
A DEAL IN OSTRICHES 
‘Talking of the prices of birds, I’ve seen an ostrich that cost three hundred pounds,’ said the Taxidermist, recalling his youth of travel. ‘Three hundred pounds!’ 

He looked at me over his spectacles. ‘Fve seen another that was refused at four.’ 

'No,’ he said, ‘it wasn’t any fancy points. They was just plain ostriches. A little olf colour, too— owing to dietary. And there wasn’t any particular restriction of the demand cither. You’d have thought five ostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman. But the point was, one of 'em had swallowed a diamond. 

‘The chapnt got it oflf was Sir Mohini Padishah, a tremendous swell, a Piccadilly swell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt might say up to the neck of him, and then an ugly black head and a whopping turban, with this diamond in it. The blessed bird pecked suddenly and had it, and when the chap made a fuss it realized it had done wrong, I suppose, and went and mixed itself with the others to preserve its incog. It all happened in a minute. I was among the first to arrive, 
and there was this heathen going over his gods, and two sailors and the man who had charge of the birds laughing fit to split. It was a rummy way of losing a jewel, come to think of it. The man in charge hadn’t been about just at the moment^ so that he didn’t know which bird it was. 
Clean lost, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see. I didn’t feel half sorry, to tdl you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the truth. The beggar had been swaggering over his blessed diamond ever since he came aboard, 

•A thing like that goes from stem to stern of a ship in no time. Everyone was talking about it. Padishah went below to hide his feelings. At dinner — he pigged at a table by himself, him and two other Hindoos — the captain kind of jeered at him about it, and he got very excited. He 
112 
A DEAL IN OSTRICHES 
turned round and talked into my ear. He would not buy the birds; he would have his diamond. He demanded his rights as a British subject. His diamond niust be found. 
He was firm upon that. He would appeal to the House of Lords. The man in charge of the birds was one of those wooden-headed chaps you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can’t get a new idea into anyhow. He refused any proposal to interfere with the birds by way of medicine. His instructions were to feed them so-and-so and treat them so-and-so, and it was as much as his place was worth not to feed them so-and-so and treat them so-and-so. Padishah had wanted a stomach pump— though you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can’t do that to a bird, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know. 
This Padishah was full of bad law, like most of these blessed Bengalis, and talked of having a lien on the birds, 
and so forth. But an old boy, who said his son was a London barrister, aigued that what a bird s^wallowed be- 
came ipso facto part of the bird, and that Padishah’s only remedy lay in an action for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt damages, and even then it might be possible to show contributory negligence. He hadn’t any right of w'ay about an ostrich that didn’t belong to him. Tliat upset Padishah extremely, the more so as most of us expressed an opinion that that was the reason- 
able view. There wasn’t any lawyer aboard to seule the matter, so we all talked pretty free. At last, after Aden, 
it appears that he came round to the general opinion, and went privately to the man in charge and made an. offer for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all five ostriches. 

‘The next morning there was a fine shindy at breakfast. 
The man hadn’t any authority to deal with the birds, and nothing on earth would induce him to sell; but it seems he told Padishah that a Eurasian named Potter had already made him an offer, and on that Padishah denounced Potter before us all. But 1 think the most of us thought it rather smart of Potter, and I know that when Potter said that he’d wired at Aden to London to buy the birds, and would have an answer at Suez, I cursed pretty richly at a lost opportunity. 
A DEAL IN OSTRICHES 113 

‘At Suez, Padishah gave way to tears— actual wet tears 
— when Potter became the owner of the birds, and offered him two hundred and fifty right off for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the five, being more than two hundred per cent on what Potter had given. 
Potter said lie’d be hanged if he parted with a feather of them — that he meant to kill them ofl* one by one and find the diamond; but afterwards, thinking it over, he relented a liltle. He was a gambling hound, was tliis Potter, a little queer at cards, and this kind of prize-packet business must have suited him down to the ground. Any- 
how, he offered, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a lark, to sell the birds separately to separate people by auction at a starting price of £80 for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a bird. But one of them, he said, he meant to keep for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt luck. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must understand this diamond was a valuable one — a little Jey/ chap, a diamond merchant, who was with as, had put it at three or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt four thousand when Padishah had shown it to him — and this idea of an ostrich gamble caught on. Now it happened that Vd been having a few talks on general subjects with the man who looked after these ostriches, and quite incidentally he’d said one of the birds was ailing, and he fancied it had indigestion. It had one feather in its tail almost all white, by which I knew it, and so when, next day, the auction started with it, i capped Padishah’s eighty-five by ninety. I fancy I was a bit too sure and eager with my bid, and some of the others spotted the fact that I was in the know. And Padishah went for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that particular bird like an irresponsible lunatic. At last the Jew diamond merchant got it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 
£175, and Padishah said £180 just after the hammer came dowm— so Potter declared. At any rate the Jew merchant secured ic, and there and then he got a gun and shot it. 
Potter made a Hades of a fuss because he said it would injure the sale of the other three, and Padishah, of course, 
behaved like an idiot; but all of us were very much excited. 
I can tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I was precious glad when that dissection was 
114 
A DEAL IN OSTRICHES 
over, and no diamond had turned up — precious glad. Fd gone to one-forty on that particular bird myself. 

‘The little Jew was like most Jews — he didn’t make any great fuss over bad luck; but Potter declined to go on with the auction until it was understood that the goods could not be delivered until the sale was over. The little Jew wanted to argue that the case was exceptional, and as the discussion ran pretty even, the thing was postponed until the next morning. We had a lively dinner-table that evening, I can tell you, but in the end Potter got his way, 
since it would stand to reason he would be safer if he stuck to all the birds, and that we owed him some con- 
sideration for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his sportsmanlike behaviour. And the old gentleman whose son was a lawyer said he’d been thinking the thing over and that it was very doubtful if, when a bird had been opened and the diamond recovered, it ought not to be handed back to the proper owner. I remember I suggested it came under the laws of treasure-trove — which was really the truth of the matter. There was a hot argu- 
ment, and we settled it was certainly foolish to kill the bird on board the ship. Then the old gentleman, going at large through his legal talk, tried to make out the sale was a lottery and illegal, and appealed to the captain; but Potter said he sold the birds as ostriches. He didn’t want to sell any diamonds, he said, and didn’t offer that as an inducement. The three birds he put up, to the best of his knowledge and belief, did not contain a diamond. It was in the one he kept — so he hoped. 

‘Prices ruled high next day all the same. The fact that now there \vere four chances instead of five of course caused a rise. The blessed birds averaged £227, and, oddly enough, this Padishah didn’t secure one of ’em — not one. 
He made too much shindy, and when he ought to have been bidding he was talking about liens, and, besides. 
Potter was a bit down on him. One fell to a quiet little oflScer chap, another to the little Jew, and the third was 
A DEAL IN OSTRICHES 115 

syndicated by the engineers. And then Potter seemed suddenly sorry for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt having sold them, and said he’d flung away a clear thousand pounds, and that very likely he’d draw a blank and that he always hitd been a fool, but when I went and had a bit of a talk to him, with the idea of getting him to hedge on his last chance, I found he’d already sold the bird he’d reserved to a political chap that was on board, a chap who’d been studying Indian morals and social questions in his vacation. That last was the three hundred pounds bird. Well, they landed three of the blessed creatures at Brindisi — though the old gentleman said it was a breach of the Customs regulations — ^and Potter and Padishah landed too. The Hindoo seemed half mad as he saw his blessed diamond going this way and that, so to speak. He kept on saying he’d get an injunc- 
tion — he had injunction on the brain — and giving his name and address to the chaps who’d bought the birds, so that they’d know where to send the diamond. None of them wanted his name and address, and none of them would give their own. It was a fine row 1 can tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt — on the platform. They all went ofl' by different trains. 1 came on to Southampton, and there I saw the last of the birds, 
as I came ashore; it was the one the engineers bought, and it was standing up near the bridge, in a kind of crate, and looking as leggy and silly a setting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a valuable diamond as ever you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw — if it was a setting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a valuable diamond. 

^ How did it end? Oh! like that. Well — perhaps. Yes, there’s one more thing that may throw light on it. A week or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so after landing I was down Regent Street doing a bit of shopping, 
and who should I see arm-in-arm and having a purple time of it but Padishah and Potter. If you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt come to think of it 

‘Yes. Fve thought that. Only, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see, there’s no doubt the diamond was real. And Padishah was an eminent Hindoo. I’ve seen his name in the papers— often. 
But whether the bird swallowed the diamond certainly is another matter, as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say.’ 
THROUGH A WINDOW 
After his legs were set, they carried Bailey into the study and pul him on a couch before the open window. There he lay, a live — even a feverish man down to tiie loins, and below that a double-barrelled mummy swathed in white wrappings. He tried to read, evea tried to write a little, 
but most of the time lie looked out of the window. 

He had thought the window cheerful to begin with, 
but now he thanked God for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it many times a day. Within, 
the room was dim and grey, and in the reflected light the wear of the furniture showed plainly. His medicine and drink "stood on the little table, with such litter as the bare branches of a bunch of grapes or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the ashes pf a cigar upon a green plate, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a day old evening paper. The view out- 
side was flooded with light, and across the corner of it came the head of the acacia, and at the foot the top of the balcony-railing of hammered iron. In the foreground was the weltering silver of the river, never quid and yet never tiresome. Beyond was the reedy bank, a broad stretch of meadow land, and then a dark line of trees ending in a group of poplars at the distant bend of the river, and, upstanding behind them, a square church tower. 

Up and down the river, all day long, things were passing. 
Now a string of barges drifting down to London, piled with lime or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt barrels of beer; then a steam-launch, disengaging heavy masses of black smoke, and disturbing the whole width of the river with long rolling waves; then an im- 
petuous electric launch, and then a boatload of pleasure- 
seekers, a solitary sculler, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a four from some rowing club. 
Perhaps the river was quietest of a morning or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt late at night. One moonlight night some people drifted down singing, and with a zither playing — sounded very pleasantly across the water. 
THROUGH A WINDOW 117 

In a few days Bailey began to recognize some of the craft; in a week he knew the intimate history of half- 
a-dozen. The launch Luzoriy from Fitzgibbon’s, two miles up, would go fretting by, sometimes three or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt four times a day, conspicuous with its colouring of Indian-red and yellow, and its two Oriental attendants; and one day, to Bailey’s vast amusement, the house -boat Purple Emperor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt came to a stop outside, and breakfasted in the most shame- 
less domesticity. Then one afternoon, the captain of a slow-moving barge began a quarrel with his wife as they came into sight from the left, and had carried it to personal violence before he vanished behind the window-frame to the right. Bailey regarded all this as an entertain- 
ment got up to while away his illness, and applauded all the more moving incidents. Mrs. Green, coming in at raie intervals with his meals, would catch him clapping his hands or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt soltly cT>ing, ‘Encore!* But the river players had other engagements, and his encore went unheeded. 

‘I should never have thought I could take such an interest in things that did not concern me,’ said Bailey to Wildcrspin, who used to come in in his nervous, friendly way and try to comfort the suflerer by being talked to. 
‘ i thought this idle capacity was distinctive of little children and old maids. But it’s just circumstances. I simply can’t work, and things have to drift; it’s no good to fret and struggle. And so 1 lie here and am as amused as a baby with a rattle, at this river and its afi'airs, 

‘ Sometimes, of course, it gets a bit dull, but not often. 

‘1 would give anything, Wilderspin, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a swamp— just one swamp — once. Heads swimming and a steam launch to the rescue, and a chap or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so hauled out with a boat- 
hook. . . . There goes Fitzgibbon’s launch! They have a new boat-hook, I see, and the little blackie is still in the dumps. I don’t think he’s very well, Wilderspin. He’s been like that for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three days, squatting sulky-fashion 
118 THROUGH A WINDOW 

and meditating over the churning of the water. Unwhole- 
some for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him to be always staring at the frothy water running away from the stern.’ 

They watched the little steamer fuss across the patch of sunlit river, suffer momentary occultation from the acacia, and glide out of sight behind the dark window- 
frame. 

‘I’m getting a wonderful eye for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt details,’ said Bailey: 
‘ I spotted that new boat-hook at once. The other nigger is a funny little chap. He never used to swagger with the old boat-hook like that.’ 

‘Malays, aren’t they?’ said Wilderspin. 

‘ Don’t know,’ said Bailey. ‘I thought one called all that sort of mariner Lascar.’ 

Then he began to tell Wilderspin what he knew of the private affairs of the house-boat, Purple Emperor. ‘ Funny,’ 
he said, ‘how these people come from all points of the compass — from Oxford and Windsor, from Asia and Africa 
— and gather and pass opposite the window just to enter- 
tain me. One man floated out of the infinite the day before yesterday, caught one perfect crab opposite, lost and recovered a scull, and passed on again. Probably he will never come into my life again. So far as I am con- 
cerned, he has lived and had his little troubles, perhaps thirty — perhaps forty — years, on the earth, merely to make an ass of himself for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three minutes in front of my window. 
Wonderful thing, Wilderspin, if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt come to think of it.’ 

‘Yes,’ said Wilderspin; ‘w/f / it?’ 

A day or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two after this Bailey had a brilliant morning. 
Indeed, towards the end of the affair, it became almost as exciting as any window show very well could be. We will, 
how ever, begin at the beginning. 

Bailey was all alor.c in the house, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his housekeeper had gone into the town three miles away to pay bills, and the servant had her holiday. The morning began dull. A canoe went up about half-past nine, and later a boat -load 
THROUGH A WINDOW 119 

of camping men came down. But this was mere margin. 
Things became cheerful about ten o’clock. 

It began with something white fluttering in the remote distance where the three poplars mark the river bend. 
"Pocket-handkerchief,’ said Bailey; when he saw it. ‘No. 
Too big! Flag perhaps.’ 

However, it was not a flag, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it jumped about. ‘Man in whites running fast, and this way,’ said Bailey. ‘That's luck! But his whites are precious loose!’ 

Then a singular thing happened. There was a minute pink gleam among the dark trees in the distance, and a little pufif of pale grey that began to drift and vanish east- 
ward. The man in white jumped and continued running. 
Presently the report of the shot arrived. 

‘What the devil!’ said Bailey. ‘Looks as if someone was shooting^t him.’ 

lie sat up stilfly and stared hard. The white figure was coming along the pathway through the corn. ‘It’s one of those niggers from the Fitzgibbons’,’ said Bailey; ‘or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may I be hanged! 1 wonder v/hy he keeps sawing with his arm.’ 

Then three other figures became indistinctly vi-^ible against the dark background of the trees. 

Abruptly on the opposite bank a man walked into the picture. He was black -bearded, dressed in flannels, had a red belt, and a vast grey felt hat. He walked, leaning very much forward and with his hands swinging before him. Behind him one could sec the grass swept by the towing-rope of the boat he was dragging. He was stead- 
fastly regarding the white figure that was hurrying through the corn. Suddenly he stopped. Then, with a peculiar gesture, Bailey could see that he began pulling in the tow- 
rope hand over hand. Over the water could be heard 
(.he voices of the people in the still invisible boat. 

‘What are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt after, Hagshot?’ said someone. 

The individual with the red belt shouted something that 
120 
THROUGH A WINDOW 
was inaudible, and went on lugging in the rope, looking over his shoulder at the advancing white figure as he did so. He came down the bank, and the rope bent a lane among the reeds and lashed the water between his pulls. 

Then just the bows of the boat came into view, with the towing-mast and a tall, fair-haired man standing up and trying to see over the bank. The boat bumped un- 
expectedly among the reeds, and the tall, fair -haired man disappeared suddenly, having apparently fallen back into the invisible part of the boat. There was a curse and some indistinct laughter. Hagshot did not laugh, but hastily clambered into the boat and pushed off. Abruptly the boat passed out of Bailey’s sight. 

But it was still audible. The melody of voices suggested 
.that its occupants were busy telling each other what to do. 

The running figure was drawing near the jbank. Bailey could now see clearly that it was one of Fitzgibbon’s Orientals, and began to realize what the sinuous thing the man carried in his hand might be. Three other men followed one another through the corn, and the foremost carried what was probably the gun. They were perhaps two hundred yards or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more behind the Malay. 

‘It’s a man hunt, by all that’s holy!’ said Bailey. 

The Malay stopped for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment and surveyed the bank to the right. I nen he left the path, and, breaking through the corn, vanished in that direction. The three pursuers followed suit, and their heads and gesticulating arms above the corn, after a brief interval, also went out of Bailey’s field of vision. 

Bailey so far forgot himself as to swear. ‘Just as things were getting lively!’ he said. Something like a woman’s shriek came through the air. Then shouts, a howl, a dull whack upon the balcony outside that made Bailey jump, 
and then the report of a gun. 

‘This is precious hard on an invalid,* said Bailey, 

But more was to happen yet in his picture. In fata, a

121 
great deal more. The Malay appeared again, running now along the bank up stream. His stride had more swing and less pace in it than before. He was threatening some- 
one ahead with the ugly krees be carried. The blade, 
Bailey noticed, was dull — it did not shine as steel should. 

Then came the tall, fair man, brandishing a boat-hook, 
and after him three other men in boating costume running clumsily with oars. The man with the grey hat and red belt was not with them. After an interval the three men with the gun reappeared, still in the com, but now near the river bank. They emerged upon the towing-patli, and hurried after the others. The opposite bank was left blank and desolate again. 

The sick-room was disgraced by more profanity. ‘I would give my life to see the end of this,’ said Hailey. 
There were indistinct shouts up stream. Once they seemed to be coming nearer, but they disappointed him. 

Bailey sat and grumbled. He was still grumbling wh<!ai his eye caught something black and round among tlM waves. ‘Hullo!’ he said. He looked narrowly and ^aw two triangular black bodies frothing every now and then about a yard in front of this. 

He was still doubtful when the little band of pujsuera came into sight again, and began to point to this :3oatiag object. They were talking eagerly. Then the mam with the gun took aim. 

‘He’s swimming the river, by George!’ said Bailey. 

The Malay looked round, saw the gun, and went under. 
He came up so close to Bailey’s bank of the aver that one of the bars of the balcony hid him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment. Aa he emerged the man with the gun fired. The Malay kepi steadily onward — Bailey could sec the wet hair on his forehead now and the krees between his teeth — and was presently hidden by the balcony. 

This seemed to Bailey an unendurable wrong. The man was lost to him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ever now, so he thought. Why couldn’t 
122 THROUGH A WINDOW 

the brute have got himself decently caught on the opposite bank, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt shot in the water? 

‘ It’s worse than Edwin Drood,’ said Bailey. 

Over the river, too, things had become an absolute blank. 
All seven men had gone down stream again, probably to get the boat and follow across. Bailey listened and waited. 
There was silence. ‘Surely it’s not over like this,’ said Bailey. 

Five minutes passed — ten minutes. Then a tug with two barges went up stream. The attitudes of the men upon these were the attitudes of those who see nothing remarkable in earth, water, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sky. Clearly the whole affair had passed out of sight of the river. Probably the hunt had gone into the beech woods behind the house. 

‘Confound it! ’ said Bailey. ‘To be continued again, and no chance this time of the sequel. But this is hard on a sick man.’ 

He heard a step on the staircase behind him, and looking round saw the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt open. Mrs. Green came in and sat down, panting. She still had her bonnet on, her purse in hex hand, and her little brown basket upon her arm. ‘Oh, 
there!’ she said, and left Bailey to imagine the rest. 

‘Have a little whisky and water, Mrs. Green, and tell me about it,’ said Bailey. 

Sipping a little, the lady began to recover her powers of explanation. 

One of those black creatures at the Fitzgibbons’ had gone mad, and was running about with a big knife, stabbing people. He had killed a groom, and stabbed the under - 
butler, and almost cut the arm off a boating gentleman. 

‘ Running amuck with a krees,’ said Bailey. ‘ I thought that was it.’ 

And he rvas hiding in the wood when she came through it from the town. 

‘What! Did he run after you?’ asked Bailey, with a certain touch of glee in his voice. 
THROUGH A WINDOW 123 

‘No, that was the horrible part of it,’ Mrs. Green explained. She had been right through the woods and had never known he was there. It was only when she met young Mr. Fitzgibbon carrying his gun in the shrubbery that she heard anything about it. Apparently, what upset Mrs. Green was the lost opportunity for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt emotion. She was determined, however, to make the most of what was left her. 

‘To think he was there all the time!’ she said, over and over again. 

Bailey endured this patiently enough for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt perhaps ten minutes. At last he thought it advisable to assert himself. 
‘It’s twenty past one, Mrs. Green,’ he said. ‘Don’t you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think it time you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt got me something to eat?’ 

This brought Mrs. Green suddenly to her knees. 

‘Oh Lord, sifl’ she said. ‘Oh! don’t go making me go out of this room, sir, till 1 know he's caught. He might have got into the house, sir. He might be creeping, 
creeping, with that knife of his, along the passage this very ’ 

She broke off suddenly and glared over him at the window. Her lower jaw dropped. Bailey turned his head sharply. 

For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the space of half a second things seemed just as they were. There was the tree, the balcony, the shining river^ 
the distant church tower. Then he noticed that the acacia was displaced about a foot to the right, and that it was quivering, and the leaves were rustling. The tree was shaken violently, and a heavy panting was audible. 

In another moment a hairy brown hand had appeared and clutched the balcony railings, and in another the face of the Malay was peering through these at the man on the couch. His expression was an unpleasant grin, by reason of the krees he held between his teeth, and he was bleeding from an ugly wound in his cheek. His hair wet to drying stuck out like horns from his head. His body 
124 THROUGH A WINDOW 

wu bare save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the wet trousers that clung to him. 
Bailey's first impulse was to spring from the couch, but his legs reminded him that this was impossible. 

By means of the balcony and tree the man slowly raised himself until he was visible to Mrs. Green. With a choking cry she made for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and fumbled with the handle. 

Bailey thought swiftly gnd clutched a medicine bottle in either hand. One he flung, and it smashed against the acada. Silently and deliberately, and keeping his bright eyes fixed on Bailey, the Malay clambered into the balcony. 
Bailey, still clutching his second bottle, but with a sickening, 
sinking feeling about his heart, watched first one leg come over the railing and then the other. 

It was Bailey’s impression that the Malay took about an hour to get bis second leg over the rail. The period that elapsed before the sitting position was changed to a standing one seemed enormous — days, weeks, possibly a year or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so. 
Yet Bailey had no clear impression of anything going on in his mind during that vast period, except a vague wonder at his inability to throw the second medicine bottle. Sud- 
denly the Malay glanced over his shoulder. There was the crack of a rifle. He flung up his arms and came down upon the couch. Mrs. Green began a dismal shriek that seemed likely to last until Doomsday. Bailey stared at the brown body with its shoulder blade driven in, that writhed painfully across his legs and rapidly staining and soaking the spotless bandages. Then he looked at the long krees, 
with the reddish streaks upon its blade, that lay an inch beyond the tiembliug brown fingers upon the floor. Then at Mrs. Green, who had backed hard against the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and was staring at the body and shrieking in gusty outbursts as if she would wake the dead. And then the body was shaken by one last convulsive effort. 

The Malay gripped the krees, tried to raise himself with his left hand, and collapsed. Then he raised his head, 
stared for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment at Mrs. Green, and twisting his face 
THROUGH A WINDOW 125 

round looked at Bailey. With a gasping groan the dying man succeeded in clutching the bedclothes with his dis- 
abled band, and by a violent ciTort, which hurt Bailey’s legs exceedingly, writhed sideways towards what must be his last victim. Tlien something seemed released in Bailey’s mind and he brought down the second bottle with all his strength on to the Malay’s face. The krees fell heavily upon the floor. 

‘Easy with those legs,’ said Bailey, as young Fitzgibbon and one of the boating party lifted the body oft’ him. 

Young Fitzgibbon was very white in the face. ‘ I didn’t mean to kill him,’ he said. 

* It’s just as well,’ said Bailey, 
THE FLYING MAN 
The Ethnologist looked at the bhimraj feather thoughtfully. 
‘They seemed loth to part with it,’ he said. 

‘It is sacred to the Chiefs,’ said the lieutenant; ‘just as yellow silk, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, is sacred to the Chinese Emperor.’ 

The Ethnologist did not answer. He hesitated. Then opening the topic abruptly, ‘What on earth is this cock- 
and-bull story they have of a flying man?’ 

The lieutenant smiled faintly. ‘What did they tell you?’ 

‘1 see,’ said the Ethnologist, ‘that you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know of your fame.’ 

The lieutenant rolled himself a cigarette. ‘ I don’t mind hearing about i t once more. How does it stand at present ? ’ 

‘It’s so confoundedly childish,’ said the Ethnologist, 
becoming irritated. ‘How did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt play it off upon them?’ 

The lieutenant made no answer, but lounged back in his folding-chair, still smiling. 

‘Here am I, come four hundred miles out of my way to get what is left of the folk-lore of these people, before they are utterly demoralized by missionaries and the military, and all 1 And are a lot of impossible legends about a sandy-haired scrub of an infantry lieutenant. How he is invulnerable — how he can jump over elephants — how he can fly. That’s the toughest nut. One old gentleman described your wi.t.gs, said they had black plumage and were not quite as long as a mule. Said he often saw you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt by moonlight hovering over the crests out towards the Shendu country. Confound it, man ! ’ 

The lieutenant laughed cheerfully. ‘Go on,’ he said. 
‘Go on.’ 

The Ethnologist did. At last he wearied. ‘To trade so,’ 
he said, ‘on these unsophisticated children of the moun- 
tains. How could you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt bring yourself to do it, man?’ 
THE FLYING MAN 
127 
‘Tm sorry,’ said the lieutenant, ‘but truly the thing was forced upon me. I can assure you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I was driven to it. 
And at the time I had not the faintest idea of how the Chin imagination would take it. or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt curiosity. I can only plead it was an indiscretion and not malice that made me replace the folk-lore by a new legend. But as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt seem aggrieved, 

I w'ill try and explain the business to you. 

'It was in the time of the last Lushai expedition but one, and Walters thought these people you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have been visiting were friendly. So, with an airy confidence in my capacity for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt taking care of myself, he sent me up the gorge 
— fourteen miles of it — with three of the Derbyshire men and half a dozen Sepoys, two mules, and his blessing, to see what popular feeling was like at that village you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt visited. 
A force of ten— not counting the mules— fourteen miles, 
and during a war! you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw the road?’ 

" Roacir said the Ethnologist. 

'Ifs better now than it was. When we went up we had to wade in the river for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a mile where the valley narrows, 
wdth a smart stream frothing round our knees and the stones as slippery as ice. There it w'as 1 dropped ray rifle. After- 
wards the Sappers blasted the clift' with dynamite and made the convenient way you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt came by. Then below, where those very high cliffs come, we had to keep on dodging across the river — 1 should say we crossed it a dozen times in a couple of miles. 

‘We got in sight of the place early the next morning. 
you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know how it lies, on a spur halfway between the big hills, and as we began to appreciate how wickedly quiet the village lay under the sunlight, we came to a stop to consider. 

‘At that they fired a lump of filed brass idol at us, just by way of a welcome. It came twanging down the slope to the right of us where the boulders arc, missed my shoulder by an inch or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so, and plugged the mule that carried all the provisions and utensils. I never heard such a death-rattle 
128 THE FLYING MAN 

before or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt since. And at that we became aware of a number of gentlemen carrying matchlocks, and dressed in things like plaid dusters, dodging about along the neck between the village and the crest to the east. 

‘“Right about face,” I said. “Not too close together.” 

‘And with that encouragement my expedition of ten men came round and set off at a smart trot down the valley again hitherward. We did not wait to save anything our dead had carried, but we kept the second mule with us— he carried my tent and some other rubbish— out of a feeling of friendship. 

‘So ended the battle — ingloriously. Glancing back, 1 saw the valley dotted with the victors, shouting and firing at us. But no one was hit. These Chins and their guns are very little good except at a sitting shot. They will sit and finick over a boulder for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hours taking aim, and when they fire running it is chiefly for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt stage effect. Hooker, one of the Derbyshire men, fancied himself rather with the rifle, and stopped behind for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half a minute to try his luck as we turned the bend. But he got nothing. 

‘I’m not a Xenophon to spin much of a yarn about my retreating army. We had to pull the enemy up twice in the next two miles when he became a bit pressing, by exchanging shots with him, but it was a fairly monotonous affair — hard breathing chiefly — until we got near the place where the hills run in towards the river and pinch the valley into a gorge. And there we very luckily caught a glimpse of half a dozen round black heads coming slanting-ways over the hill to the left of us — ^thc east that is — and almost parallel with us. 

‘At that I called a halt. “Look here,” says I to Hooker and the other Englishmen; “what are we to do now?”and 1 pointed to the heads. 

“‘Headed orf, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I’m a nigger,” said one of the men. 

“We shall be,” said another. “you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know the Chin way, George?” 
THE FLYING MAN 129 

‘“They can pot every one of us at fifty yards,” says Hooker, “in the place where the river is narrow. It’s just suicide to go on down.” 

*I looked at the hill to the right of us. It grew steeper lower down the valley, but it still seemed climbable. And all the Chins we had seen hitherto had been on the other side of the stream. 

‘“It’s that or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt stopping,” says one of the Sepoys. 

‘ So we started slanting up the hill. There was something faintly suggestive of a road running obliquely up the face of it, and that we followed. Some Chins presently came into view up the valley, and I heard some shots. Then I saw one of the Sepoys was sitting down about thirty yards below us. He had simply sat down without a word, 
apparently not wishing to give trouble. At that I called a halt again; i told Hooker to try another shot, and went back and found the man was hit in the leg. I took him up, carried him along to put him on the mule — already pretty well laden with the tent and other things which we had no time to take off. When I got up to the rest with him. Hooker had his empty Martini in his hand and was grinning and pointing to a motionless black spot up the valley. All the rest of the Chins were behind boulders or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt back round the bend. “Five hundred yards,” 
says Hooker, “if an inch. And I’ll swear I hit him in the head.” 

‘I told him to go and do it again, and with that we went on again. 

‘Now the hillside kept getting steeper as we pushed on, 
and the road we were following more and more of a shelf. 
At last it was mere cliff above and below us. “It’s the best road I have seen yet in Chin Lushai land,” said I to encourage the men, though I had a fear of what was coming. 

‘And in a few minutes the way bent round a corner of the cliff. Then, finis ! the ledge came to an end. 

B 
130 THE FLYING MAN 

‘As soon as he grasped the position one of the Derbyshire men fell a-swearing at the trap we had fallen into. The Sepoys halted quietly. Hooker grunted and reloaded, and went back to the bend. 

‘Then two of the Sepoy chaps helped their comrade down and began to unload the mule. 

‘Now, when I came to look about me, I began to think we had not been so very unfortunate after all. We were on a shelf perhaps ten yards across at its widest. Above it the cliff projected so that we could not be shot down upon, and below was an almost sheer precipice of perhaps two or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three hundred feet. Lying down we were invisible to anyone across the ravine. The only approach was along the ledge, and on that one man was as good as a host. 
We were in a natural stronghold, with only one dis- 
advantage, our sole provision against hunger and thirst was one live mule. Still we were at most eight or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nine miles from the main expedition, and no doubt, 
after a day or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so, they would send up after us if we did not return. 

‘After a day or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so ... ’ 

The lieutenant paused. ‘Ever been thirsty, Graham?’ 

‘Not that kind,’ said the Ethnologist. 

‘H’m. We had the whole of that day, the night, and the next day of it, and only a trifle of dew we wrung out of our clothes and the tent. And below us was the river going giggle, giggle, round a rock in raid stream. I never knev such a barrenness of incident, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt such a quantity of sensation. The sun might have had Joshua’s command still upon it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all the motion one could see; and it blazed like a near furnace. Towards the evening of the first day one of the Derbyshire men said something — nobody heard what — and went off round the bend of the cliff. We heard shots, and when Hooker looked round the corner he was gone. And in the morning the Sepoy whose leg was shot was in delirium, and jumped or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fell over the cliff. Then 
THE FLYING MAN 
l3i 

we took the mule and shot it, and that must needs go over the cliff too in its last struggles, leaving eight of us. 

‘We could see the body of the Sepoy down below, with the head in the water. He was lying face downwards, 
and so far as I could make out was scarcely smashed at all. Badly as the Chins might covet his head, they had the sense to leave it alone until the darkness came. 

‘At first we talked of all the chances there were of the main body hearing the firing, and reckoned whether they would begin to miss us, and all that kind of thing, but we dried up as the evening came on. The Sepoys played games with bits of stone among themselves, and afterwards told stories. The night was rather chilly. The second day nobody spoke. Our lips were black and our throats afire, 
and we lay about on the ledge and glared at one another. 
Perhaps it's as well we kept our thoughts to ourselves. 
One of the British soldiers began writing some blasphemous rot on the rock with a bit of pipeclay, about his last dying will, until I stopped it. As I looked over the edge down into the valley and saw the river rippling I was nearly tempted to go after the Sepoj^ It seemed a pleasant and desirable thing to go rushing down through the air with something to drink — or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt no more thirst at any rate — at the bottom. T remembered in time, though, that I was the officer in command, and my duty to set a good example, 
and that kept me from any such foolishness. 

‘Yet, thinking of that, put an idea into my head. I got up and looked at the tent and tent ropes, and wondered why I had not thought of it before. Then I came and peered over the cliff again. This time the height seemed greater and the pose of the Sepoy rather more painful. 
But it was that or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nothing. And to cut it short, 
I parachuted. 

‘ I got a big circle of canvas out of the tent, about three times the size of that table-cover, and plugged the hole in the centre, and I tied eight ropes rouild it to meet in

the middle and make a parachute. The other chaps lay about and watched me as though they thought it was a new kind of delirium. Then I explained my notion to the two British soldiers and how I meant to do it, and as soon as the short dusk had darkened into night, I risked it. They held the thing high up, and I took a run the whole length of the ledge. The thing filled with air like a sail, but at the edge I will confess I funked and pulled up. 

‘As soon as I stopped I was ashamed of myself— as well I might be in front of privates— and went back and started again. Oflf I jumped this time — with a kind of sob, I remember — clean into the air, with the big white sail bellying out above me. 

‘I must have thought at a frightful pace. It seemed a long time before I was sure that the thing meant to keep steady. At first it heeled sideways. Then. I noticed the face of the rock which seemed to be streaming up past me, and me motionless. Then I looked down and saw in the darkness the river and the dead Sepoy rushing up towards me. But in the indistinct light I also saw three Chins, seemingly aghast at the sight of me, and that the Sepoy was decapitated. At that I wanted to go back again. 

‘Then my boot was in the mouth of one, and in a moment he and I were in a heap with the canvas fluttering down on the top of us. I fancy I dashed out his brains with my foot. I expected nothing more than to be brained myself by the other two, but the poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt heathen had never heard of Baldwin, and incontinently bolted. 

‘I struggled out of the tangle of dead Chin and canvas, 
and looked round. About ten paces off lay the head of the Sepoy staring in the moonlight. Then I saw the water and went and drank. There wasn’t a sound in the world but the footsteps of the departing Chins, a faint shout from above, and the gluck of the water. So soon as I had drunlrmy full I started oflf down the river. 
THE FLYING MAN 
133 
‘That about ends the explanation of the flying man story. I never met a soul the whole eight miles of the way. I got to Walters’ camp by ten o’clock, and a bom idiot of a sentinel had the cheek to fire at me as I came trotting out of the darkness. So soon as I had hammered my story into Winter’s thick skull, about fifty men started up the valley to clear the Chins out and get our men down. 
But for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part I had too good a thirst to provoke it by going with them. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have heard what kind of a yarn the Chins made of it. Wings as long as a mule, eh? — And black feathers! 
The gay lieutenant bird! Well, well.’ 

The lieutenant meditated cheerfully for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment. Then he added. “you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would scarcely credit it, but when they got to the ridge at last, they found two more of the Sepoys had jumped over.’ 

‘The rest were all right?’ asked the Ethnologist. 

‘Yes,’ said the lieutenant; ‘the rest were all right, barring a certain thirst, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know.’ 

And at the memory he helped himself to soda and whisky again. 
THE DIAMOND MAKER 
Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane until nine in the evening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was disinclined either for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt entertainment or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt further work. So much of the sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left visible spoke of a serene night, and I determined to make my way down to the Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my bead by watching the variegated lights upon the river. Beyond comparison the night is the best time for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the waters, and the lights of this transition age, red, glaring orange, gas-yellow, 
and electric white, are set in shadowy otitlines of every possible shade between grey and deep purple. Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the Embankment, and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster, warm grey against the starlight. The black river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its surface. 

‘A warm night,’ said a voice at my side. 

I turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning over the parapet beside me. It was a refined face, not unhandsome, though pinched and pale enough, 
and the coat collar turned up and pinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a uniform. I felt I was committed to the price of a bed and breakfast if I answered him. 

I looked at him curiously. Would he have anything to tell me worth the money, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was he the common incapable 
— incapable even of telling his own story? There was a quality of intelligence in his forehead and eyes, and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that decided me. 
THE DIAMOND MAKER 135 

‘Very warm,’ said 1; ‘but not too warm for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt us here,’ 

‘No,’ he said, still looking across the water, ‘it is pleasant enough here . . . just now.’ 

‘It is good,’ he continued after a pause, ‘to find any- 
thing so restful as this in London. After one has been fretting about business all day, about getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers, I do not know what one would do if it were not for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt such pacific corners.’ He spoke with long pauses between the sentences. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must know a little of the irksome labour of the world, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would not be here. But I doubt if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can be so brain- 
weary and footsore as I am. . . . Bah ! Sometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle. I feel inclined to throw the whole thing over — name, wealth, and position — and take to some modest trade. But I know if I abandoned ray ambition— hardly as she uses me — I should have nothing but remorse left for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the rest of my days.’ 

He became silent. I looked at him in astonishment. 
If ever I saw a man hopelessly hard -up it was the man in front of me. He was ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though he had been left in a dust-bin for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a week. And he was talking to me of the irksome worries of a large business. I almost laughed outright. Either he was mad or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt playing a sorry jest on his own poverty. 

‘If high aims and high positions,’ said I, ‘have theii drawbacks of hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. Influence, the power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than ourselves; and there is even a certain gratification in display. . . .’ 

My banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste. 
1 spoke on the spur of thc-contrast of his appearance and speech. I was sorry even while I was speaking. 

He turned a haggard but very composed face upon me. 
Said he: ‘I forgot myself. Of course you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would not understand.’ 
136 
THE DIAMOND MAKER 
He measured me for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment. ‘No doubt it is very absurd. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will not believe me even when I tell you, 
so that it is fairly safe to tell you. And it will be a comfort to tell someone. I really have a big business in hand, 
a very big business. But there are troubles just now. 
The fact is ... I make diamonds.’ 

‘I suppose,’ said I, ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are out of work just at present?’ 

‘ I am sick of being disbelieved,’ he said impatiently, and suddenly unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that was hanging by a cord round his neck. From this he produced a brown pebble. ‘ I wonder if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know enough to know what that is?’ He handed it to me. 

Now, a year or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a London science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and mineralogy. The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, though far too large, 
being almost as big as the top of my thumb. I took it, 
and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the carved faces peculiar to the most precious of minerals. 
I took out my penknife and tried to scratch it — vainly. 
Leaning forward towards the gas -lamp, I tried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white line across that with the greatest ease. 

I looked at my interlocutor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt with rising curiosity. ‘It certainly is rather like a diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt get it?’ 

‘I tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I made it,’ he said. ‘Give it back to me.’ 

He replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket. ‘ I will sell it you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt one hundred pounds,’ he suddenly whispered eagerly. With that my suspicions returned. The thing might, after all, be merely a lump of that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with an accidental resemblance in shape to the diamond. or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt if it was a diamond, how came he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds? 
THE DIAMOND MAKER 137 

We looked into one another’s eyes. He seemed eager, 
but honestly eager. At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to sell. Yet I am a poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible gap in my fortunes, 
and no sane man would buy a diamond by gaslight from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only. Still, a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of pounds. Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist without being mentioned in every book of gems, 
and again I called to mind the stories of contraband and light-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape. I put the question of purchase on one side. 

‘How did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt get it?’ said 1. 

‘ I made it.’ 

I had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial ‘diamonds were very small. I shook my head. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt seem to know something of this kind of thing. 
I will tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little about myself. Perhaps. then you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may think better of the purchase.’ He turned round with his back to the river, and put his hands in his pockets. 
He sighed. ‘I know you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will not believe me.’ 

‘Diamonds,’ he began — and as he spoke his voice lost its faint flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an educated man — ‘are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure, the carbon crystallizes out, not as black-lead or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt charcoal-powder, but as small diamonds. 
So much has been known to chemists for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt years, but no one yet has hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up the carbon, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt exactly the right pressure for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the best results. Consequently the diamonds made by chemists are smaU and dark, and worthless as jewels. Now I, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, have given up my life to this problem — given my life to it. 

‘I began to work at the conditions of diamond making 
138 THE DIAMOND MAKER 

when I was seventeen, and now I am thirty-two. It seemed to me that it might take all the thought and energies of a man for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ten years, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt twenty years, but, even if it did, the game was still worth the candle. Suppose one to have at last just hit the right trick, before the secret got out and diamonds became as common as coal, one might realize millions. Milhons ! ’ 

He paused and looked for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my sympathy. His eyes shone hungrily. ‘To think,’ said he, ‘that I am on the verge of it all, and here! 

‘1 had,’ he proceeded, ‘about a thousand pounds when I was twenty-one, and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would keep my researches going. A year or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly, and then I continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sec, if once I had let out what I was doing, other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a genius as to have been sure of coming in first, in the case of a race for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the discovery. And you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see it was important that if I really meant to make a pile, people should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt among all my apparatus. 
The money simply flowed away. 1 grudged myself every- 
thing except scientific appliances. I tried to keep things going by a little teac^hing, but I am not a very good teacher, 
and I have no university degree, nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt very much education except in chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt precious little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing. Three years ago 1 settled the problem of the composition of the flux, and got near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a certain 
THE DIAMOND MAKER 139 

carbon composition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing tightly, and heating.’ 

He paused. 

‘Rather risky,’ said 1. 

‘Yes. It burst, and smashed all niy windows and a lot of iny apparatus; but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless. Following out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture from which the things were to crystallize, I hit upon some researches of Daubr6e’s at the Paris Labor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt at eyrie des Poudres et Salpetres, He exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder, too strong to burst, and I found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike the South African bed in which diamonds are found. Jt was a tremendous strain on my resources, 
but I got a steel cylinder made for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my purpose after his pattern. I put in all my stuff and my explosives, built up a fire in my furnace, put the whole concern in, and — 
went out for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a walk.’ 

1 could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner. 
‘Did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt not think it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the place?’ 

‘It was in the interest of science,’ he said ultimately. 
‘There was a costermonger family on the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt below, a begging-letter writer in the room behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs. Perhaps it was a bit thought- 
less. But possibly some of them were out. 

‘When I came back the thing w^as just where T left it, 
among the white-hot coals. The explosive hadn’t burst the case. And then 1 had a problem to face. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know time is an important element in crystallization. If you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hurry the process the crystals are small — it is only by prolonged stand- 
ing that they grow to any size. I resolved to let this apparatus cool for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two years, letting the temperature go down slowly during that time. And 1 was now quite out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room, as well as my hunger to satisfy, T had scarcely a penny in the world. 
14^ THE DIAMOND MAKER 

‘I can hardly tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all the shifts I was put to while I was making the diamonds. I have sold newspapers, 
held horses, opened cab-doors. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt many weeks I addressed envelopes. I had a place as assistant to a man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one side of the road while he called down the other. Once for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and 1 begged. What a week that was! One day the fire was going out and I had eaten nothing all day, and a little chap taking his girl out, gave me sixpence— to show off. Thank heaven for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt vanity! How the fishshops smelt! But I went and spent it all on coals, and had the furnace bright red again, 
and then Well, hunger makes a fool of a man. 

‘At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out. I took my cylinder and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands, and I scraped out jthe crumbling lava-Uke mass with a chisel, and hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate. And I found three big diamonds and five small ones. As I sat on the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hammering, my door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt opened, and my neighbour, the begging-letter writer, 
came in. He was drunk — as he usually is. “’Nerchist,” 
said he. “You’re drunk,” said 1. “’Structive scoundrel,” 
said he. “Go to your father,” said I, meaning the Father of Lies. “Never you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mind,” said he, and gave me a cunning wink, and hiccupped, and leaning up against the door, with his other eye against the door-post, began to babble of how he had been prying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that morning, and how they had taken down everything he had to say — “’siffiwas a ge’m,” said he. Then I suddenly realized 1 was in a hole. 
Either 1 should have to tell these police my little secret, 
and get the whole thing blown upon, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt be lagged as an Anarchist. So 1 went up to my neighbour and look him by the collar, and rolled him about a bit, and then I gathered up my diamonds and cleared out. The evening newspapers called my den the Kentish Town Bomb

and go and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot wait. And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply stuck to the one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it back. I am going about now with several hundred thousand pounds- 
worth of diamonds round my neck, and without either food or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt shelter. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are the first person I have taken into my confidence. But I like your face and 1 am hard- 
driven.’ 

He looked into my eyes. 

‘It would be madness,’ said I, ‘for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me to buy a diamond under the circumstances. Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about in my pocket. Yet I more than half believe your story. I will, if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like, do this: come to my oflSce to-morrow. . . .’ 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think I am a thief!’ said he keenly. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will tell the police. I am not coming into a trap.’ 

‘ Somehow I am assured you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are no thief. Here is my card. Take that, anyhow. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt need not come to any appointment. Come when you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will.’ 

He took the card, and an earnest of my good-will. 

‘Think better of it and come,’ said I. 

He shook his head doubtfully. ‘I will pay back your half-crown with interest some day — such interest as will amaze you,’ said he. ‘Anyhow, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will keep the secret? 
. . . Don’t follow me.’ 

He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps under the archway leading into Essex Street, 
and I let him 20 . And that was the last I ever saw of him. 

Afterwards 1 had two letters from him asking me to send bank-notes — not cheques — ^to certain addresses. I weighed the matter over, and took what I conceived to 
!42 THE DIAMOND MAKER 

be the wisest course. Once he called upon me when I was out. My urchin described him as a very thin, dirty, 
and ragged man, with a dreadful cough. He left no message. That was the finish of him so far as my story goes. I wonder sometimes what has become of him. 
Was he an ingenious monomaniac, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt has he really made diamonds as he asserted? 
The latter is just sufficiently credible to make me think at times that I have missed the most brilliant opportunity of my life. He may of course be dead, and his diamonds carelessly thrown aside — one, I repeat, was almost as big as my thumb. or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he may be still wandering about trying to sell the things. It is Just possible he may yet emerge upon society, and, passing athwart my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to the w^ealthy and the well -advertised, 
reproach me silently for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my want of enterprise. I some- 
'imes think 1 might at least have risked five pounds. 
THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 
The chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at Camberwell and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire, and his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician but fond of whisky, a heavy, red-haired brute with irregular teeth. 
He doubted the existence of the Deity but accepted Carnot’s cycle, and he had read Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came out of the mysterious East, 
and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd called him Pooh -bah. Holroyd liked a nigger help because he would stand kicking~a habit with Holroyd — and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn the ways of it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilization Holroyd never fully realized, though just at the end he got some inkling of them. 

To define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, 
perhaps, more negroid than anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and his nose had a bridge. 
Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black, and the whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheek-bones and narrow chin gave his face something of the viperine V. 
His head, too, was broad behind, and low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in the reverse way to a European’s. He was short of stature and still shorter of English. In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known marketable value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs, and — especially after whisky — lectured to him against superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however, 
shirked the discussion of his gods, even though he was kicked for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it. 
144 THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 

Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the stoke-hole of the Lord Clive, from the Straits Settlements and beyond, into London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness and riches of London, where all the women are white and fair and even the beggars in the streets are white; and he had arrived, 
with newly-earned gold coins in his pocket, to worship at the shrine of civilization. The day of his landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a wind -worried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets, but he plunged boldly into the delights of Shadwell, and was presently cast up, 
shattered in health, civilized in costume, penniless, and, 
except in matters of the direst necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt James Holroyd, and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell. And to James Holroyd bullying was a labour of love. 

There were three dynamos with their engines at Camber- 
well. The two that have been there since the beginning are small machines; the larger one was new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps hummed over the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! 
whool between their poles. One was loose in its founda- 
tions and kept the shed vibrating. But the big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core, which somehow set part of the ironwork humim'ng. The place made the visitor’s head reel with the throb, throb, throb of the engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the spinning ball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and over all the deep, unceasing, 
surging note of the big dynamo. This last noise was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi accounted it unto the monster for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mightiness and pride. 

If it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment. It was a steady 
THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 145 

Stream of din, from which the ear picked out first one thread and then another; there was the intermittent snorting, 
panting, and seething of the steam-engines, the suck and thud of their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving wheels came round, a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from the dynamos; and, over all, sometimes in- 
audible, as the ear tired of it, and then creeping back upon the senses again, was this trombone note of the big machine. 
The floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt never felt steady and quiet beneath one’s feet, 
but quivered and jarred. It was a confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send anyone’s thoughts jerking into odd zigzags. And for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three months, while the big strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd who was a black- 
leg, and Azuma-zi who was a mere black, were never out of the stir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates. 

Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine soon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. ‘ Look at that,’ said Holroyd ; 
‘where’s your ’eathen idol to match ’im?’ And Azuma-zi looked. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi heard: ‘Kill a hundred men. Twelve per cent on the ordinary shares,’ said Holroyd, ‘and that’s something like a Gord.’ 

Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium. He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so ways in which a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample of its quality. After that, in the breathing times of his labour — it was heavy labour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd’s — 
Azuma-zi would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then the brushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes, at 
146 THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 

which Holroyd would swear, but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The band ran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of the piston. So it lived all day in this big airy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; 
not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knew — mere captive devils of the British Solomon 
— had been, but a machine enthroned. Those two smaller dynamos Azuma-zi by force of contrast despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord of the Dynamos. 
They were fretful and irregular, but the big dynamo was steady. How great it was! How serene and easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the Buddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living! 
The great black coils spun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the brushes, and the deep note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected Azuma-zi queerly. 

Azuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord of the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it with a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand close to the colossus, and look up at the great leather band running overhead. There was a black patch on the band that came round, and it pleased him somehow among all the clatter to watch this return again and again. Odd thoughts spun with the whirl of it. 
Scientific people tell us that savages give souls to rocks and trees — and a machine is a thousand times more alive than a rock or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a tree. And Azuma-zi was practically a savage still; the veneer of civilization lay no deeper than his slop suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face and hands. His father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone; kindred blood, it may be, had splashed the broad wheels of Juggernaut. 
THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 147 

He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and handling the great dynamo that was fascinating him. 
He polished and cleaned it until the metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of service in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning coils gently. The gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people in London hid their gods. 

At last his dim feelings grew more distinct and took shape in thoughts, and at last in acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then, when Holroyd was away, 
he went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant, and prayed it to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did so a rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing machine-shed,, and the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was radiant with pale gold. Then Azuma-zj knew that his service was acceptable to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he had done, and he had indeed been very much alone in London. Even when his work- 
time was over, which was rare, he loitered about the shed. 

The next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to the Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, 
‘Thou seest, O my Lord!’ and the angry whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it appeared to him that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different note mingled with the sounds of the dynamo. ‘My Lord bides his time," said Azuma-zi to himself. ‘The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe." And he waited and watched for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the reckoning. One day there was evidence of short cir- 
cuiting, and Holroyd, making an unwary examination — it was in the afternoon — got a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi from behind the engine saw him jump off and curse at the peccant coil. 

‘He is warned," said Azuma-zi to himself. ‘Surely my Lord is very patient." 
148 THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 

Holroyd had at first initiated his ‘nigger’ into such elementary conceptions of the dynamo’s working as would enable him to take temporary charge of the shed in his absence. But v/hen he noticed the manner in which A2uma-zi hung about the monster he became suspicious. 
He dimly perceived his assistant was ‘up to something,’ 
and connecting him with the anointing of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place, he issued an edict, shouted above the confusion of the machinery, 
‘Don’t ’ee go nigh that big dynamo any more. Pooh -bah, 
or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt aTl take thy skin oflF!’ Besides, if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it was plain sense and decency to keep him away from it. 

Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the Lord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he turned to go away. 
As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and glared at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm and sounded like four words in his native tongue. 

It is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad. The incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little store of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy, at last, 
into something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of making Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion. 

That night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed together. The shed was lit with one big arc-light and winked and flickered purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and their pistons beat loud and steadily. The world outside seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely silent, too, since the riot 
THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 149 

of the machinery drowned every external sound. Far away was the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy house# 
behind, and above was the deep blue sky and the pale little stars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands were running, and went into the shadow by the big dynamo. Holroyd heaird a click, and the spin of the armature changed. 

‘What are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt dewin’ with that switch?’ he bawled in surprise. ‘Han’t I told you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ’ 

Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi’s eyes m the Asiatic came out of the shadow towards him. 

In another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the great dynamo. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt coffee-headed fool!’ gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his throat. ‘Keep off those contact rings.’ In another moment he was tripped and reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine. 

The messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter’s lodge by the gate. Azuraa-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could make nothing of the black’s incoherent English, and hurried on to the shed. The machines were all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be disarranged. There was, however^ 
a queer smell of singed hair. Then he saw an odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo, 
and, approacliing, recognized the distorted remains of Holroyd. 

The man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face, and shut his eyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so that he should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get advice and help. 

When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had been a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt strangely elated, and knew that 
150 THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 

the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon him. His plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the station, and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide. 
This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a few q*xestions. Did he see Holroyd kill himself? Azuma-zi explained he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo. 
It was not a difficult examination, being untinctured by suspicion. 

The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from the machine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained tablecloth. Somebody, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man. The expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt seven or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric ’ railway. Azuma-zi, answering or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mis- 
understanding the questions of the people who had by authority or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt impudence come into the shed, was presently sent back to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of course a crowd collected outside the gates of the yard — a crowd, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt no known reason, always hovers for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a day or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two near the scene of a sudden death in London — two or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three reporters percolated somehow into the engine shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert cleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist. 

Presently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with it. Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over again in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still. An hour after the murder, to anyone coming into the shed things would have looked exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there. Peeping presently from his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and whirl beside his little brothers, and the driving-wheels were beating round and 
THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 15! 

the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had been earlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view it had been a most insignificant incident — the mere temporary deflection of a current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of the scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt under the straps between tlie engines and the dynamos. 

‘Have I not served my Lord?’ said Azuma-zi inaudibly from his shadow, and the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked at the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a little in abeyance since Holroyd’s death resumed its sway. 

Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a second from its steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god. 

The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him, scribbling on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the monster. 

Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry? His servant was ready. 

Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. 
The scientific manager suddenly ceased his writing, walked down the shed to the endmost of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes. 

Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow by the switch. There he waited. Presently the manager’s footsteps could be heard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the stoker crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big d3mamo suddenly fizzled, and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him. 

The scientific manager was gripped round the body and 
152 THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 

swung towards the big dynamo. Kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist’s head down with his hands, 
he loosened the grip on his waist and swung round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him again, 
putting a curly head against his chest, and they swayed and panted as it seemed for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an age or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so. Then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The black yelled hideously. 

They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently slipped from the vice of the teeth or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt parted with some ear — the scientific manager wondered which at the time — tried to throttle him. The scientific manager was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something with his hands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick foot- 
•steps sounded on the floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar. 

The ofliicer of the company who had entered stood staring as Azuma-zi caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion, and then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently distorted. 

‘Fm jolly glad you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt came in when you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did,’ said the scientific manager, still sitting on the floor. 

He looked at the still quivering figure. ‘It is not a nice death to die, apparently — ^but it is quick.’ 

The official was still staring at the body. He was a man of slow apprehension. 

There was a pause. 

The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. 
He ran his fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro several times. 

‘Poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Holroyd! I see now.’ Then almost mechanically he went towards the switch in the shadow and turned the current Into the railway circuit again. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and fell 
THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS 1153 

forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud and clear, and the armature beat the air. 

So ended prematurely the worship of the Dynaino Deity, 
perhaps the most short-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice. 
THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 

It is a moot point whether burglary is to be considered as a sport, a trade, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an art. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a trade, the technique is scarcely rigid enough, and its claims to be considered an art are vitiated by the mercenary element that qualifies its triumphs. On the whole it seems to be most justly ranked as sport, a sport for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt which no rules are at present formulated, 
and of which the prizes are distributed in an extremely informal manner. It was this informality of burglary that led to the regrettable extinction of two promising beginners at Hammerpond Park. 

The stakes offered in this affair consisted chiefly of diamonds and other personal bric-a-brac belonging to the newly married Lady Aveling. Lady Aveling, as the reader will remember, was the only daughter of Mrs. Montague Pangs, the well-known hostess. Her marriage to Lord Aveling was extensively advertised in the papers, the quan- 
tity and quality of her wedding presents, and the fact that the honeymoon was to be spent at Hammerpond. The announcement of these valuable prizes created a consider- 
able sensation in the small circle in which Mr. Teddy Watkins was the undisputed leader, and it was decided that, accompanied by a duly qualified assistant, he should visit the village of Hammerpond in his professional capacity. 

Being a man of naturally retiring and modest disposition, 
Mr. Watkins determined to make this visit incog., and after due consideration of the conditions of his enterprise, 
he selected the role of a landscape artist and the unassuming surname of Smith. He preceded his assistant, who, it was decided, should join him only on the last afternoon of his stay at Hammerpond. Now the village of Hammerpond is perhaps one of the prettiest little corners in Sussex; 
THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 155 

many thatched houses still survive, the flint-built church with its tall spire nestling under the down is one of the nnest and least restored in the county, and the beech- 
woods and bracken jungles through which the road runs to the great house are singularly rich in whai the vulgar artist and photographer call ‘bits.’ So that Mr. Watkins, 
on his arrival with two virgin canvases, a brand-new easel, 
a paint-box, portmanteau, an ingenious littlg Ladder made in sections (after the pattern of the late lamented master Charles Peace), crowbar, and wire coils, found himself welcomed with effusion and some curiosity by half-a-dozen other brethren of the brush. It rendered the disguise he had chosen unexpectedly plausible, but it inflicted upon him a considerable amount of aesthetic conversation for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt which he was very imperfectly prepared. 

‘Have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt exhibited very much?’ said Young Porson in the bar-parlour of the ‘Coach and Horses,’ where Mr. 
Watkins was skilfully accumulating local information on the night of his arrival. 

‘Very little,’ said Mr. Watkins, ‘just a snack here and there.’ 

‘Academy?’ 

‘ in course. And at the Crystal Palace.’ 

‘Did they hang you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt well?’ said Porson. 

‘ Don’t rot,' said Mr. Watkins; ‘I don't like it.’ 

‘ 1 mean did they pul you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in a good place?’ 

‘Whadyer mean?’ said Mr. Watkins suspiciously. ‘One 
‘ud think you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were trying to make out I’d been put away.’ 

Porson had been brought up by aunts, and was a gentle- 
manly young man even for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an artist; he did not know what being ‘put away’ meant, but he thought it best to explain that he intended nothing of the sort. As the ques- 
tion of hanging seemed a sore point with Mr. Watkins, he tried to divert the conversation a little. 

‘Do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt do figure-work at all?’ 
15fi THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 

‘No, never had a head for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt figures,’ said Mr. Watkins. 
‘My miss — Mrs. Smith, I mean, does all that.’ 

‘She paints too!’ said Porson. ‘That’s rather jolly.’ 

‘Very,’ said Mr. Watkins, though he really did not think so, and, feeling the convei sation was drifting a little beyond his grasp, added, ‘1 came down here to paint Hammerpond House by moonlight.’ 

‘Really!’ said Porson. ‘That’s rather a novel idea.’ 

‘Ycij,' said Mr. Watkins. ‘I thought it rather a good notion when it occurred to me. I expect to begin to- 
morrow night.’ 

‘What! you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t mean to paint in the open, by night? ' 

‘1 do, though.’ 

‘But how will you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see your canvas?’ 

‘Have a bloomin’ cop’s ’ began Mr. Watkins, rising 

too quickly to the question, and then realizing this, bawled to Miss Durgan for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt another glass of beer. ‘I’m goin’ 
to have a thing called a dark lantern,’ he said to Porson. 

‘But it’s about new moon now,’ objected Porson. ‘ There won’t be any moon.’ 

‘There’ll be the house,’ said Watkins, ‘at any rate. I’m goin’, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see, to paint the house first and the moon afterwards.’ 

‘Oh!’ said Porson, too staggered to continue the conversation. 

‘They doo say,’ said old Durgan, the landlord, who had maintained a respectful silence during the technical conversation, ‘as there’s no less than three p’licemen from 
'Azelworlh on dewty every night in the house — ’count of this Lady Aveling ’n her jew'ellery. One’m won fower- 
and-six last night, off second footman — ^tossin’.’ 

Towards sunset next day Mr. Watkins, virgin canvas, 
easel, and a very considerable case of other appliances in band, strolled up the pleasant pathway through the beech- 
woods to Hammerpond Park, and pitched his apparatus 
THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 157 

in a strategic position commanding the house. Here he was observed by Mr. Raphael Sant, who was retu rning across the park from a study of the cbalk-pits. His curiosity having been fired by Person’s account of the new arrival, he turned aside with the idea of discussing nocturnal art. 

Mr. Watkins was apparently unaware of his approach. 
A friendly conversation with Lady Hammerpond’s butler had just terminated, and that individual, surrounded by the three pet dogs which it was his duty to take for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt an airing after dinner had been served, was receding in the distance. Mr. Watkins was mixing colour with an air of great industry. Sant, approaching more nearly, was surprised to see the colour in question was as harsh and brilliant an emerald green as it is possible to imagine. 
Having cultivated an extreme sensibility to colour from his earliest years, he drew the air in sharply between his teeth at the very first glimpse of this brew. Mr. Watkins turned round. He looked annoyed. 

‘What on earth are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt going to do with that beastly green?’ said Sant. 

Mr. Watkins realized that his zeal to appear busy in the eyes of the butler had evidently betrayed him into some technical error. He looked at Sant and hesitated. 

‘Pardon my rudeness,’ said Sant; ‘but really, that green is altogether too amazing. It came as a shock. What do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt mean to do with it?’ 

Mr. Watkins was collecting his resources. Nothing could save the situation but decision. ‘If you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt come here interrupting my work,’ he said, ‘I’m a-goin’ to paint your face with it.’ 

Sant retired, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he was a humorist and a peaceful man. 
Going down the hill he met Person and Wainwright. 
‘Either that man is a genius or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he is a dangerous lunatic,* 
said he. ‘Just go up and look at his green.’ And he continued his way, his countenance brightened by a pleasant 
158 THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 

anticipation of a cheerful affray round an easel in the gloaming, and the shedding of much green paint. 

But to Person and Wainwright Mr. Watkins was less aggressive, and explained that the green was intended to be the first coating of his picture. It was, he admitted in response to a remark, an absolutely new method, invented by himself. But subsequently he became more reticent; he explained he was not going to tell every passer-by the secret of his own particular style, and added some scathing remarks upon the meanness of people ‘hanging about’ to pick up such tricks of the masters as they could, which immediately relieved him of their company. 

Twilight deepened, first one, then another star appeared. 
The rooks amid the tall trees to the left of the house had long since lapsed into slumbrous silence, the house itself lost all the details of its architecture and became a dark grey outline, and then the windows of the salon shone out brilliantly, the conservatory was lighted up, and here and there a bedroom window burnt yellow. Had anyone approached the easel in the park it would have been found deserted. One brief uncivil word in brilliant green sullied the purity of its canvas. Mr. Watkins was busy in the shrubbery with his assistant, who had discreetly joined him from the carriage-drive, 

Mr. Watkins was inclined to be self-congratulatory upon irfhe ingenious device by which he had carried all his apparatus boldly, and in the sight of all men, right up to the scene of operations. ‘That’s the dressing-room,’ he said to his assistant, ‘and, as soon as the maid takes the candle away and goes down to supper, we’ll call in. My! how nice the house do look, to be sure, against the starlight, and with all its windows and lights! Swopme, Jim, I almost wish I was a painter -chap. Have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fixed that there wire across the path from the laundry.’ 

He cautiously approached the house until he stood below the dressing-room window, and began to put together his 
THE HAMMERiPONb PARK BURGLARY 

folding ladder. He was much too experienced a prac- 
titioner to feel any unusual excitement. Jim was recon- 
noitring the smoking-room. Suddenly, close beside Mr. 
Watkins in the bushes, there was a violent crash and a stifled curse. Someone had tumbled over the wire which his assistant had just arranged. He heard feet running on the gravel pathway beyond. Mr. Watkins, like all true artists, was a singularly shy man, and he incontinently dropped his folding ladder and began running circum- 
spectly through the shrubbery. He w^as indistinctly aware of two people hot upon his heels, and he fancied that he distinguished the outline of his assistant in front of him. 
In another moment he had vaulted the low stone wall bounding the shrubbery, and was in the open park. Two thuds on the turf followed his own leap. 

It was a close chase in the darkness through the trees. 
Mr. Watkins was a loosely-built man and in good training, 
and he gained band -over-hand upon the hoarsely panting figure in front. Neither spoke, but, as Mr. Watkins pulled up alongside, a qualm of awful doubt came over him. 
The other man turned his head at the same moment and gave an exclamation of surprise. ‘It’s not Jim,’ thought Mr. Watkins, and simultaneously the stranger flung him- 
self, as it were, at Watkins’ knees, and they were forthwith grappling on the ground together. ‘Lend a hand. Bill,’ 
cried the stranger as the third man came up. And Bill did 
— two bands in fact, and some accentuated feet. The fourth man, presumably Jim, had apparently turned aside and made off in a different direction. At any rate, he did not join the trio. 

Mr. Watkins’ memory of the incidents of the next two minutes is extremely vague. He has a dim recollection of having his thumb in the corner of the mouth of the first man, and feeling anxious about its safety, and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some seconds at least he held the head of the gentleman answering to the name of Bill, to the ground by the hair. He was 
160 filE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 

also kicked in a great number of different places, apparently by a vast multitude of people. Then the gentleman who was not Bill got his knee below Mr. Watkins’ diaphragm, 
and tried to curl him up upon it. 

When his sensations became less entangled he was sitting upon the turf, and eight or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ten men— the night was dark, 
and he was rather too confused to count — standing round him, apparently waiting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him to recover. He mourn- 
fully assumed that he was captured, and would probably have made some philosophical reflections on the fickleness of fortune, had not his internal sensations disinclined him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt speech. 

He noticed very quickly that his wrists were not hand- 
cuffed, and then a flask of brandy was put in his hands. 
This touched him a little — ^it was such unexpected kindness. 

‘He’s a-comin’ round,’ said a voice which he fancied as belonging to the Hammerpond second footman. 

‘We’ve got ’em, sir, both of ’em,’ said the Hammerpond butler, the man who had handed him the flask, ‘Thanks to you.'' 

No one answered this remark. Yet he failed to see how it applied to him. 

‘He’s fair dazed,’ said a strange voice; ‘the villains half- 
murdered him.’ 

Mr. Teddy Watkins decided to remain fair dazed until he had a better grasp of the situation. He perceived that two of the black figures round him stood side-by-side with a dejected air, and there was something in the carriage of their shoulders that suggested to his experienced eye hands that were bound together. Two! In a flash he rose to his position. He emptied the little flask and staggered — 
obsequious hands assisted him — ^to his feet. There was a sympathetic murmur. 

‘ Shake hands, sir, shake hands,’ said one of the figures near him. ‘Permit me to introduce myself. I am very greatly indebted to you. It was the jewels of my wife. 
THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 161 

Lady Aveling, which attracted these scoundrels to the house,’ 

‘Very glad to make your lordship’s acquaintance,’ said Teddy Watkins. 

‘ I presume you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw the rascals making for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the shrubbery, 
and dropped down on them?’ 

‘That’s exactly how it happened,’ said Mr. Watkins. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt should have waited till they got in at the window,’ 
said Lord Aveling; ‘they would get it hotter if they had actually committed the burglary. And it was lucky for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two of the policemen were out by the gates, and followed up the three of you. I doubt if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt could have secured the two of them — ^though it was confoundedly plucky of you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all the same.’ 

‘Yes, I ought to have thought of all that,’ said Mr. 
Watkins; ‘but one can’t think of everything.’ 

‘Certainly not,’ said Lord Aveling. ‘1 am afraid they have mauled you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little,’ he added. The party was now moving towards the house. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt walk rather lame. May I offer you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my arm?’ 

And instead of entering Hammerpond House by the dressing-room window, Mr. Watkins entered it — slightly intoxicated, and inclined now to cheerfulness again — on the arm of a real live peer, and by the front door. ‘This,’ 
thought Mr. Watkins, ‘is burgling in style!’ The 
‘scoundrels,’ seen by the gaslight, proved to be mere local amateurs unknown to Mr. Watkins, and they were taken down into the pantry, and there watched over by the three policemen, two gamekeepers with loaded guns, 
the butler, an ostler, and a carman, until the dawn allowed of their removal to Hazelhurst police-station. Mr. Watkins was made much of in the saloon. They devoted a sofa to him, and would not hear of a return to the village that night. Lady Aveling was sure he was brilbantly ori ginal, and said her idea of Turner was just such another rough, half-inebriated, deep-eyed, brave, and clever man. 
162 THE HAMMERPOND PARK BURGLARY 

Someone brought up a remarkable little folding-ladder that had been picked up in the shrubbery, and showed him how it was put together. They also described how wires had been found in the shrubbery, evidently placed there to trip up unwary pursuers. It was lucky he had escaped these snares. And they showed him the jewels. 

Mr. Watkins had the sense not to talk too much, and in any conversational diflBculty fell back on his internal pains. 
At last he was seized with stiffness in the back, and yawning. 
Everyone suddenly awoke to the fact that it was a shame to keep him talking after his affray, so he retired early to his room, the little red room next to Lord Aveling’s suite. 
« « « 

The dawn found a deserted easel bearing a canvas with a green inscription, in the Hammerpond Park, and it found Hammerpond House in commotion. But if the dawn found Mr. Teddy Watkins and the Aveling diamonds, it did not communicate the information to the police. 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 
One saw Monson’s Flying Machine from the windows of the trains passing either along the South-Western main line or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt along the line between Wimbledon and Worcester Park, — to be more exact, one saw the huge scaffoldings which limited the flight of the apparatus. They rose over the tree-tops, a massive alley of interlacing iron and timber, 
and an enormous web of ropes and tackle, extending the best part of two miles. From the Leatherhead branch this alley was foreshortened and in part hidden by a hill with villas ; but from the main line one had it in profile, a complex tangle of girders and curving bars, very impressive to the excursionists from Portsmouth and Southampton and the West. Monson had taken up the work where Maxim had left it, had gone on at first with an utter contempt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the journalistic wit and ignorance that had irritated and hampered his predecessor, and had spent (it was said) 
rather more than half his immense fortune upon his expeiiments. The results, to an impatient generation, 
seemed inconsiderable. When some five years had passed after the growth of the colossal iron groves at Worcester Park, and Monson still failed to put in a fluttering appearance over Trafalgar Square, even the Isle of Wight trippers felt their liberty to smile. And such intelligent people as did not consider Monson a fool stricken with the mania for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt invention, denounced him as being (for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt no particular reason) a self -advertising quack. 

Yet now and again a morning trainload of season- 
ticket holders would see a white monster rush headlong through the airy tracery of guides and bars, and hear the further stays, nettings, and buffers, snap, creak, and groan with the impact of the blow. Then there would be an efflorescence of black-set white-rimmed faces along the sides 
164 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

of the train, and the morning papers would be neglected for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a vigorous discussion of the possibility of flying (in which nothing new was ever said by any chance), until the train reached Waterloo, and its cargo of season-ticket holders dispersed themselves over London. or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the fathers and mothers in some multitudinous train of weary excur- 
sionists returning exhausted from a day of rest by the sea, 
would find the dark fabric, standing out against the evening sky, useful in diverting some bilious child from its introspec- 
tion, and be suddenly startled by the swift transit of a huge black flapping shape that strained upward against the guides. It was a great and forcible thing beyond dispute, and excellent for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt conversation; yet, all the same, it was but flying in leading-strings, and most of those who witnessed it scarcely counted its flight as flying. More of a switchback it seemed to the run of the folk. 

Monson, I say, did not trouble himself very keenly about the opinions of the press at first. But possibly he, even, 
had formed but a poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt idea of the time it would take before the tactics of flying were mastered, the swift assured adjust- 
ment of the big soaring shape to every gust and chance movement of the air; nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt had he clearly reckoned the money this prolonged struggle against gravitation would cost him. And he was not so pachydermatous as he seemed. Secretly he had his periodical bundles of cuttings sent him by Romeike, he had his periodical reminders from his banker; and if he did not mind the initial ridicule and scepticism, he felt the growing neglect as the months went by and the money dribbled away. Time was when Monson had sent the enterprising journalist, keen after readable matter, empty from his gates. But when the enterprising journalist ceased from troubling, Monson was anything but satisfied in his heart of hearts. StiU day by day the work went on, and the multitudinous subtle diflS- 
culties of the steering diminished in number. Day by day, 
165 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

too, the money trickled away, until his balance was no longer a matter of hundreds of thousands, but of tens. 
And at last came an anniversary. 

Monson, sitting in the little drawing-shed, suddenly noticed the date on Woodhouse’s calendar. 

‘It was five years ago lo-day that we began,’ he said to Woodhouse suddenly. 

‘Is it?’ said Woodhouse. 

‘It’s the alterations play the devil with us,’ said Monson, 
biting a paper-fastener. 

The drawings for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the new vans to the hinder screw lay on the table before him as he spoke. He pitched the mutilated brass paper-fastener into the waste-paper basket and drummed with his fingers. ‘These alterations! WiB the mathematicians ever be clever enough to save us all this patching and experimenting? Five years — ^learning by rule of thumb, when one might think that it was possible to calculate the w^ole thing out beforehand. The cost of it! J might have hired three senior https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt wranglers for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt life. 
But they’d only have developed some beautifully useless theorems in pneumatics. What a time it has been, 
Woodhouse!’ 

‘These mouldings will take three weeks,’ said Wood- 
house. ‘At special prices.’ 

‘Three weeks!’ said Monson, and sat drumming. 

‘Three weeks certain,’ said Woodhouse, an excellent engineer, but no good as a comforter. He drew the sheets towards him and began shading a bar. 

Monson stopped drumming, and began to bite his finger- 
nails, staring the while at Woodhouse’s head. 

‘How long have they been calling this Monson’s Folly?’ 
he said suddenly. 

'Oh I Year or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so,’ said Woodhouse carelessly, without looking up. 

Monson sucked the air in between his teeth, and went to the window. The stout iron columns carrying the 
166 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

elevated rails upon which the start of the machine was made rose up close by, and the machine was hidden by the upper edge of the window. Through the grove of iron pillars, red painted and ornate with rows of bolts, one had a glimpse of the pretty scenery towards Esher. A train went gliding noiselessly across the middle distance, its rattle drowned by the hammering of the workmen over- 
head. Monson could imagine the grinning faces at the windows of the carriages. He swore savagely under his breath, and dabbed viciously at a blowfly that suddenly became noisy on the window-pane. 

‘What's up?’ said Woodhouse, staring in surprise at his employer. 

‘ T’m about sick of this.' 

Woodhouse scratched his cheek. ‘Oh I’ he said, after an assimilating pause. He pushed the drawing away from him. 

‘ Here these fools . . . I’m trying to conquer a new element 
—trying to do a thing that will revolutionize life. And instead of taking an intelligent interest, they grin and make their stupid jokes, and call me and my appliances names.’ 

‘Asses!’ said Woodhouse, letting his eye fall again on the drawing. 

The epithet, curiously enough, made Monson wince. 
‘ I'm about sick of it, Woodhouse, anyhow,’ he said, after a pause. 

Woodhouse shrugged his shoulders. 

‘There’s nothing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it but patience, I suppose,’ said Monson, sticking his hands in his pockets. ‘I’ve started. 
I’ve made my bed, and I’ve got to lie on it. I can’t go back. I’ll see it through, and spend every penny I have and every penny I can borrow. But I tell you, Woodhouse, 
Tm infernally sick of it, all the same. If I’d paid a tenth part of the money towards some political greaser’s expenses 
— -I’d have been a baronet before this.’ 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 167 

Monson paused. Woodhouse stared in front of him with a blank expression he always employed to indicate sympathy, and tapped his pencil-case on the table. Monson stared at him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute. 

‘Oh, damn!" said Monson suddenly, and abruptly rushed out of the room. 

Woodhouse continued his sympathetic rigour for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt perhaps half a minute. Then he sighed and resumed the shading of the drawings. Something had evidently upset Monson. 
Nice chap, and generous, but diflBcult to get on with. It was the way with every amateur who had anything to do with engineering — wanted everything finished at once. But Monson had usually the patience of the expert. Odd be was so irritable. Nice and round that aluminium rod did look now! Woodhouse threw back his head, and put it, first this side and then that, to appreciate his bit of shading better. 

‘Mr. Woodhouse,’ said Hooper, the foreman of the labourers, putting his head in at the door, 

‘Hullo!’ said Woodhouse, without turning round. 

‘Nothing happened, sir?’ said Hooper. 

‘Happened?’ said Woodhouse. 

‘The governor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt just been up the rails swearing like a tornader.’ 

"Oh!" said Woodhouse. 

‘It ain’t like him, sir.’ 

‘No?’ 

‘And I was thinking perhaps ’ 

‘Don’t think,’ said Woodhouse, still admiring the drawings. 

Hooper knew Woodhouse, and he shut the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt suddenly with a vicious slam. Woodhouse stared stonily before him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some further minutes, and then made an ineSectual effort to pick his teeth with his pencil. Abruptly he desisted, pitched that old, tried, and stumpy servitor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt across the room, got up, stretched himself, and followed Hooper. 
168 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

He looked ruffled— -it was visible to every workman he met. When a millionaire who has been spending thousands on experiments that employ quite a little army of people suddenly indicates that he is sick of the undertaking, there is almost invariably a certain amount of mental friction in the ranks of the little army he employs. And even before he indicates his intentions there are speculations and murmurs, a watching of faces and a study of straws. 
Hundreds of people knew before the day was out that Monson was ruffled, Woodhousc ruffled, Hooper ruffled. 
A workman’s wife, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance (whom Monson had never seen), decided to keep her money in the savings-bank instead of buying a velveteen dress. So far-reaching are even the casual curses of a millionaire. 

Monson found a certain satisfaction in going on the works and behaving disagreeably to as rnany people as possible. After a time even that palled upon him, and he rode off the grounds, to every one’s relief there, and through the lanes south-eastward, to the infinite tribulation of his house steward at Cheam. 

And the immediate cause of it all, the little grain of annoyance that had suddenly precipitated all this discontent with his life-work was — these trivial things that direct all our great decisions! — half a dozen ill-considered remarks made by a pretty girl, prettily dressed, with a beautiful voice and something more than prettiness in her soft grey eyes. And of these half-dozen remarks, two words especially — ‘Monson’s Folly.’ She had felt she was behaving charmingly to Monson; she reflected the next day how exceptionally effective she had been, and no one would ha\c been more amazed than she, had she learned the effect she had left on Monson’s mind. I hope, 
considering everything, that she never knew. 

‘How are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt getting on with your flying-machine?’ 
she asked. (‘ I wonder if I shall ever meet any one with the sense not to ask that,’ thought Monson.) ‘It will be 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 169 

very dangerous at first, will it not?* (‘Thinks Fm afraid.’) 
‘Jorgon is going to play presently; have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt heard him before?’ (‘My mania being attended to, we turn to rational conversation.’) Gush about Jorgon; gradual decline of conversation, ending with — ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must let me know when your flying-machine is finished, Mr. Monson, 
and then I will consider the advisability of taking a ticket.’ 
(‘One would think I was still playing inventions in the nursery. ’) But the bitterest thing she said was not meant for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Monson’s ears. To Phlox, the novelist, she was always conscientiously brilliant. ‘I have been talking to Mr. 
Monson, and he can think of nothing, positively nothing, 
but that flying-machine of his. Do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, all his workmen call that place of his ‘Monson’s Folly’? He is quite impossible. It is really very, very sad. I always regard him myself in the light of sunken treasure — the Lost Millionaire, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know.* 

She was pretty and well educated, — indeed, she had written an epigrammatic novelette; but the bitterness was that she was typical. She summarized what the world thought of the man who was working sanely, steadily, and surely towards a more tremendous revolution in the appliances of civilization, a more far-reaching alteration in the ways of humanity than has ever been effected since history began. They did not even take him seriously. In 1 little while he would be proverbial. ‘I must fly now,’ 
he said on his way home, smarting with a sense of absolute social failure. ‘I must fly soon. If it doesn’t come oflF soon, by God ! I shall run amuck.’ 

He said that before he had gone through his pass-book and his litters of papers. Inadequate as the cause seems, 
it was that girl’s voice and the expression of her eyes that precipitated his discontent. But certainly the discovery that he had no longer even one hundred thousand pounds’ 
worth of realizable property behind him was the poison that made the wound deadly. 
170 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

It was the next day after this that he exploded upon Woodhouse and his workmen, and thereafter his bearing was consistently grim for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt three weeks, and anxiety dwelt in Cheam and EweU, Malden, Morden, and Worcester Park, places that had thriven mightily on his experiments. 

Four weeks after that first swearing of his, he stood with Woodhouse by the reconstructed machine as it lay across the elevated railway, by means of which it gained its initial impetus. The new propeller glittered a brighter white than the rest of the machine, and a gilder, obedient to a > whim of Monson’s, was picking out the aluminium bars with gold. And looking down the long avenue betw'een the ropes (gilded now with the sunset), one 
•saw red signals, and two miles away an ant-hill of work- 
men busy altering the last falls of the run into a rising slope. 

‘I’ll come,^ said Woodhouse. ‘I’ll come right enough. 
But I tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it’s infernally foolhardy. If only you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would give another year ’ 

‘I tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I won’t. I tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the thing works. I’ve given years enough ’ 

‘It’s not that,’ said Woodhouse. ‘We’re all right with the machine. But it’s the steering ’ 

‘Haven’t I been rushing, night and morning, backwards and forwards, through this squirrel’s cage? If the thing steers true here, it will steer true all across England. It’s just funk, I tell you, Woodhouse. We could have gone a year ago. And besides ’ 

‘Well?’ said Woodhouse. 

‘The money!’ snapped Monson over his shoulder. 

‘Hang it! I never thought of the money,’ said Wood- 
house, and then, speaking now in a very different tone to that with which he had said the words before, he repeated, 
‘ I’ll come. Trust me.’ 

Monson turned suddenly, and saw all that Woodhouse 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 171 

had not the dexterity to say, shining on his sunset -lit face. 
He looked for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment, then impulsively extended his hand. ‘Thanks,’ he said. 

‘All right,’ said Woodhouse, gripping the hand, and with a queer softening of his features. ‘Trust me.’* 

Then both men turned to the big apparatus that lay with its flat wings extended upon the carrier, and stared at it meditatively. Monson, guided perhaps by a photographic study of the flight of birds, and by Lilienthal’s methods, 
had gradually drifted from Maxim’s shapes towards the bird form again. The thing, however, was driven by a huge screw behind in the place of the tail; and so hovering, 
which needs an almost vertical adjustment of a flat tail, 
was rendered impossible. The body of the machine was small, almost cylindrical, and pointed. Forward and aft on the pointed ends were two small petroleum engines for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the screw, and the navigators sat deep in a canoe-like recess, the foremost one steering, and' being protected by a low screen, with two plate-glass windows, from the blinding rush of air. On either side a monstrous flat framework with a curved front border could be adjusted so as either to lie horizontally or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to be tilted upward or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt down. These wings worked rigidly together, or, by releasing a pin, one could be tilted through a small angle independently of its fellow. The front edge of either wing could also be shifted back so as to diminish the wing-area about one-sixth. The machine was not only not designed to hover, but it was also incapable -of fluttering. Monson’s idea was to get into the air with the initial rush of the apparatus, and then to skim, much as a playing-card may be skimmed, keeping up the rush by means of the screw at the stern. Rooks and gulls fly enormous distances in that way with scarcely a perceptible movement of the wings. The bird really drives along on an aerial switch- 
bacL It glides slanting downward for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a space, until it has gained considerable momentum, and then altering 
172 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

the inclination of its wings, glides up again almost to its original altitude. Even a Londoner who has watched the birds in the aviary in Regent’s Park knows that. 

But the bird is practising this art from the moment it leaves its nest. It has not only the perfect apparatus, but the perfect instinct to use it. A man oS his feet lias the poorest skill in balancing. Even the simple trick of the bicycle costs him some hours of labour. The instantaneous adjustments of the wings, the quick response to a passing breeze, the swift recovery of equilibrium, the giddy, eddying movements that require such absolute precision — all that he must learn, learn with infinite labour and infinite danger, 
if ever he is to conquer flying. The flying- machine that will start off some fine day, driven by neat ‘little levers,’ 
with a nice open deck like a liner, and all loaded up with bomb-shells and guns, is the easy dreaming of a literary man. In lives and in treasure the cost of the conquest of the empire of the air may even exceed all that has been spent in man’s great conquest of the sea. Certainly it will be costlier than the greatest war that has ever devastated the world. 

No one knew these things better than these two practical men. And they knew they were in the front rank of the coming army. Yet there is hope even in a forlorn hope. 
Men are killed outright in the reserves sometimes, while others who have been left for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt dead in the thickest corner crawl out and survive. 

‘If we miss these meadows’ — said Woodhouse presently in his slow way. 

‘My dear chap,’ said Monson, whose spirits had been rising fitfully during the last few days, ‘we mustn’t miss these meadows. There’s a quarter of a square mile for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt us to hit, fences removed, ditches levelled. We shall come down all right — rest assured. And if we don’t ’ 

‘Ah!’ said Woodhouse. ‘If we don’t!’ 
173 
THp ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

Before the day of the start, the newspaper people got wind of the alterations at the northward end of the frame- 
work, and Monson was cheered by a decided change in the comments Romeike forwarded him. ‘He will be oflF some day,’ said the papers. ‘He will be off some day,’ 
said the South-Western season-ticket holders one to another, 
the seaside excursionists, the Saturday-to-Monday trippers from Sussex and Hampshire and Dorset and Devon, the eminent literary people from Haslemere, all remarked eagerly one to another, ‘He will be off some day,’ as the familiar scaffolding came in sight. And actually, one bright morning, in full view of the ten-past -ten train from Basingstoke, Monson’s flying-machine started on iti journey. 

They saw the carrier running swiftly along its rail, and the white and gold screw spinning in the air. They heard the rapid rumble of wheels, and a (hud as the carrier reached the buffers at the end of its run. Then a whir as the Flying-Machine was shot forward into the networks. 
All that the majority of them had seen and beard before. 
The thing went with a drooping flight through the frame- 
work and rose again, and then every beholder shouted, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt screamed, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt yelled, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt shrieked after his kind. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instead of the customary concussion and stoppage, the Flying Machine flew out of its five years’ cage like a bolt from a cross-bow, and drove slantingly upward into the air, curved round a little, so as to cross the line, and soared in the direction of Wimbledon Common. 

It seemed to hang momentarily in the air and grow smaller, then it ducked and vanished over the clustering blue tree-tops to the east of Coombe Hill, and no one stopped staring and gasping until long after it had dis- 
appeared. 

That was what the people in the train from Basingstoke saw. If you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt had drawn a line down the middle of that train, from engine to guard’s van, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would not have 
174 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

found a living soul on the opposite side to the flying- 
machine. It was a mad rush from window to window as the thing crossed the line. And the engine-driver and stoker never took their eyes off the low hills about Wimbledon, and never noticed that they had run clean through Coombe and Malden and Raynes Park, until, 
with returning animation, they found themselves pelting, 
at the most indecent pace, into Wimbledon station. 

From the moment when Monson had started the carrier with a ‘Now!' neither he nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Woodhouse said a word. 
Both men sat with clenched teeth. Monson had crossed the line with a curve that was too sharp, and Woodhouse had opened and shut his white lips; but neither spoke. 
Woodhouse simply gripped his seat, and breathed sharply through his teeth, watching the blue country to the west rushing past, and down, and away from him. 
Monson knelt at his post forward, and his hands trembled on the spoked wheel that moved the wings. He could see nothing before him but a mass of white clouds in the sky. 

The machine went slanting upward, travelling with an enormous speed still, but losing momentum every moment. The land ran away underneath with diminishing speed. 

‘Now!' said Woodhouse at last, and with a violent effort Monson wrenched over the wheel and altered the angle of the wings. The machine seemed to hang for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half a minute motionless in mid-air, and then he saw the hazy blue house-covered hills of Kilbum and Hampstead jump up before his eyes and rise steadily, until the little sunlit dome of the Albert Hall appeared through his windows. 
For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment he scarcely understood the meaning of this upward rush of the horizon, but as the nearer and nearer houses came into view, he realized what he had done. 
He had turned the wings over too far, and they were swooping steeply downward towards the Thames. 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 175 

The thought, the question, the realization were all the business of a second of time. ‘Too much!’ gasped Wood- 
house. Monson brought the wheel half-way back with a jerk, and forthwith the Kilburn and Hampstead ridge dropped again to the lower edge of his windows. They had been a thousand feet above Coombe and Malden station; fifty seconds after they whizzed, at a frightful pace, not eighty feet above the East Putney station, on the Metropolitan District line, to the screaming astonishment of a platformful of people. Monson flung up the vans against the air, and over Fulham they rushed up their atmospheric switchback again, steeply — too steeply. The 
’buses went floundering across the Fulham Road, the people yelled. 

Then down again, too steeply still, and the distant trees and houses about Primrose Hill leapt up across Monson’s window, and then suddenly he saw straight before him the greenery of Kensington Gardens and the towers of the Imperial Institute. They were driving straight down upon South Kensington. The pinnacles of the Natural History Museum rushed up into view. There came one fatal second of swift thought, a moment of hesitation. Should he try and clear the towers, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt swerve eastward? 

He made a hesitating attempt to release the right wing, 
left the catch half released, and gave a frantic clutch at the wheel. 

The nose of the machine seemed to leap up before him. 
The wheel pressed his hand with irresistible force, and jerked itself out of his control. 

Woodhouse, sitting crouched together, gave a hoarse cry, and sprang up towards Monson. ‘Too far!* he cried, 
and then he was clinging to the gunwale for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt dear life, and Monson had been jerked clean overhead, and was falling backwards upon him. 

So swiftly had the thing happened that barely a quarter of the people going to and fro in Hyde Park, and Brompton 
176 THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 

Road, and the Exhibition Road saw anything of the aerial catastrophe. A distant winged shape had appeared above the clustering houses to the south, had fallen and risen, 
growing larger as it did so; had swooped swiftly down towards the Imperial Institute, a broad spread of flying wings, had swept round in a quarter circle, dashed east- 
ward, and then suddenly sprang vertically into the air. 
A black object shot out of it, and came spinning downward. 
A man! Two men clutching each other! They came whirling down, separated as they struck the roof of the Students’ Club, and bounded off into the green bushes on its southward side. 

For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt perhaps half a minute, the pointed stem of the big machine still pierced vertically upward, the screw spinning desperately. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt one brief instant, that yet seemed an age to all who watched, it had hung motionless in mid-air. 
Then a spout of yellow flames licked up its length from the stern engine, and swift, swifter, swifter, and flaring like a rocket, it rushed down upon the solid mass of masonry which was formerly the Royal College of Science. The big screw of white and gold touched the parapet, and crumpled up like wet linen. Then the blazing spindle-shaped body smashed and spUntered, smashing and splintering in its fall, upon the north-westward angle of the building. 

But the crash, the flame of blazing parafiin that shot heavenward from the shattered engines of the machine, 
the crushed horrors that were found in the garden beyond the Students’ Club, the masses of yellow parapet and red brick that fell headlong into the roadway, the running to and fro of people like ants in a broken ant-hill, the galloping of flre-engines, the gathering of crowds — all these things do not belong to this story, which was written only to tell how the first of ail successful flying-machines was launched and flew. Though he failed, and failed disastrously, the record of Monson’s work remains — a sufficient monument — to guide the next of that band of gallant experimentalists who 
THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR 177 

will sooner or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt later master this great problem of flying. 
And between Worcester Park and Malden there still stands that portentous avenue of iron-work, rusting now, and dangerous here and there, to witness to the first desperate struggle for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt man’s right of way through the air. 
THE CONE 
The night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering sunset of mid-summer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the air was fresher there. 
The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark; 
beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another in low tones. 

. ‘He does not suspect?’ said the man, a little nervously. 

‘Not he,’ she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. ‘He thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no imagination, no poetry.’ 

‘None of these men of iron have,’ he said sententiously. 
‘They have no hearts.’ 

*‘He has not,’ she said. She turned her discontented face towards the window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight black oblongs — eight trucks — passed across the dim grey of the embankment, and were suddenly extin- 
guished one by one in the throat of the tunnel, which, 
with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and sound in one abrupt gulp. 

‘This country was all fresh and beautiful once,' he said; 
‘and now — it is Gehenna. Down that way — nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven. . . . But what does it matter? An end comes, an end to all this cruelty. . . . To-morrow.'* He spoke the last word in a whisper. 
THE CONE 
179 
'To-morrow,'' she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring out of the window. 

‘Dear!* he said, putting his hand on hers. 

She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another’s. Hers softened to his gaze. ‘My dear one!’ 
she said, and then: ‘It seems so strange — that you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt should 

have come into my life like this — to open’ She 

paused, 

‘To open?’ he said. 

‘AU this wonderful world ’—she hesitated, and spoke still more softly — ‘this world of love to me.’ , 

Then suddenly the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and he started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figure — silent. They saw^ the face dimly in the half-light, with unexpressive dark patches ynder the penthouse brows. Every muscle in Raut’s body suddenly became tense. When could the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have opened? What had he heard? Had he heard all? 
What had he seen? A tumult of questions. 

The new-comer’s voice came at last, after a pause that seemed interminable. ‘Well?’ he said. 

‘ I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,’ said the man at the window, gripping the window-ledge with his hand. 
His voice was unsteady. 

The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no answer to Raut’s remark. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment he stood above them. 

The woman’s heart was cold within her. ‘I told Mr. 
Raut it was just possible you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt might come back,’ she said, 
in a voice that never quivered. 

Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little work-table. His big hands were clenched; 
one saw now the fire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted, 
and then back to the woman. 
180 
THE CONE 
By this time and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the moment all three half under- 
stood one another. Yet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them. 

Tt was the husband’s voice that broke the silence at last, 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt wanted to see me?’ he said to Raut. 

Raut started as he spoke, ‘ 1 came to see you,’ he said, 
resolved to lie to the last. 

‘Yes,’ said Horrocks. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt promised,’ said Raut, ‘to show me some fine effects of moonlight and smoke.’ 

‘I promised to show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,’ repeated Horrocks, in a colourless voice. 

‘And I thought I might catch you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to-night before you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt went down to the works,’ proceeded Raut, ‘and come with you.’ 

There was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did he after all know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the moment when they heard the door, their attitudes . . . Horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half- 
light. Then he glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. ‘Of course,’ he said, ‘I promised to show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the works under their proper dramatic conditions. 
It’s odd how T could have forgotten.’ 

‘If I am troubling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ’ began Raut. 

Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry gloom of his eyes. ‘Not in the least,’ he said. 

‘Have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think so splendid?’ said the woman, turning now to her husband for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time, her confidence creeping back again, her voice just one half- 
note too high. ‘That dreadful theory of yom’S that machinery is beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly? I thought he would not spare you, Mr. Raut. It’s his great theory^ his one discovery in art.’ 
THE CONE 
181 
‘I am slow to make discoveries,’ said Horrocks grimly, 
damping her suddenly. ‘But what I discover . . He stopped. 

‘Well?’ she said. 

‘Nothing’; and suddenly he rose to his feet. 

‘1 promised to show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the works,’ he said to Raut, 
and put his big, clumsy hand on his friend’s shoulder. 
‘And you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are ready to go?’ 

‘Quite,’ said Raut, and stood up also. 

There was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness of the dusk at the other two. Horrocks’ 
hand still rested on Raut’s shoulder. Raut half fancied still that the incident v/as trivial after all. But Mrs. 
Horrocks knew her husband better, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical evil. ‘Very well,’ said Horrocks, and, 
dropping his hand, turned towards the door. 

‘My hat?’ R.aut looked round in the half-light. 

‘That’s my work-basket,’ said Mrs. Horrocks with a gust of liystericaJ laughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. ‘Here it is!’ he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she could not frame a word . ‘ Don’t go 1 ’ and ‘ Beware of him ! ’ struggled 

in her mind, and the swift moment passed. 

‘Got it?’ said Horrocks, standing with the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half open. 

Raut stepped towards him. ‘Better say good-bye to Mrs. Horrocks,’ said the ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before. 

. Raut started and turned. ‘Good evening, Mrs. 
Horrocks,’ he said, and their hands touched. 

Horrocks held the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him towards men. Raut went out, and then, 
after a w^ordless look at her, her husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut’s light footfall and her hus- 
band’s heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the 
182 
THE CONE 
passage together. The front door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving slowly, and stood watching — 
leaning forward. The two men appeared for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, 
and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. 
The lamplight fell for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know. 
Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her attitude scarcely changed. 

The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They went side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into the cinder -made by-way that presently opened out the prospecl of the valley. 

A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystei7. Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and black masses, outlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street-lamps, and here and there a gaslit window, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the yellow glare of some late-working factory or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt crowded public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the evening sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few smokeless during a season of ‘play.’ 
Here and there a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a wheel, 
black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coa! of the place. 
Nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway, and half invisible trains shunted — a steady puflBng and rumbling, 
with every now and then a ringing concussion and a series of impacts, and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view. And to the left, between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond, 
dominating the whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great 
THE CONE 
183 
cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of the big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the steam-hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither. Even as they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants, and the red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling upwards towards the sky. 

‘Certainly you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces,’ said Raut, breaking a silence that had become apprehensive. 

Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as if he were thinking out some knotty problem. 

Raut glanced at him and away again. ‘At present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe,’ he continued, looking upward; ‘the moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight.’ 

Horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly awakened. ‘Vestiges of daylight? . . . 
Of course, of course.’ He too looked up at the moon, 
pale still in the midsummer sky. ‘Come along,' he said suddenly, and, gripping Raut’s arm in his hand, made a move towards the path that dropped from them to the railway. 

Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that their lips came near to say. Hor- 
rocks’ hand tightened and then relaxed. He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in arm, and walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,’ said Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, 
striding fast and tightening the grip of his elbow the while.

THE CONE 
‘Little green lights and red and white lights, all against the haze. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have an eye for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt effect, Raut. It’s a fine effect, knd look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us as we come down the hill. That to the right is my pet — seventy feet of him. I packed him myself, 
and he’s boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt five long years. I’ve a particular fancy for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him. That line of red there — a lovely bit of warm orange you’d call it, 
Raut — that’s the puddlers’ furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three black figures — did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see the white splash of the steam-hammer then? — that’s the rolling-mills. 
Come along! Clang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the floor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 1 Sheet tin, Raut, — amazing stuff. Glass mirrors 
.are not in it when that stuff comes from the mill. And, 
squelch! — there goes the hammer again. Come along!’ 

He had to stop talking to catch at his brfeath. His arm . 
twisted into Rant’s with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks’ pull with all his strength. 

‘I say,’ he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undernote of snarl in his voice, ‘why on earth are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and dragging me along like this?’ 

At length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. ‘Nipping your arm off?’ he said. ‘Sorry. But it’s you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt taught me the trick of walking in that friendly way.’ 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt haven’t learnt the refinements of it yet then,’ said Raut, laughing artificially again. ‘By Jove! I’m black and blue.’ Horrocks offered no apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close to the fence that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger and spread out with their approach. They looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of down; the further view of Etruria

and Hanley had dropped out of sight with their descent. 
Before them, by the stile, rose a notice-board, bearing, still dimly visible, the words, ‘Beware of the trains/ half hidden by splashes of coaly mud. 

‘Fine effects,’ said Horrocks, waving his arm. ‘Here comes a train. The puffs of smoke, the orange glare, 
the round eye of light in front of it, the meodious rattle. 
Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used to be finer, 
before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the gas.’ 

‘How?’ said Raut. ‘Cones?’ 

‘Cones, my man, cones. I’ll show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt one nearer. 
The flames used to fire out of the open throats, great “■ 
what is it? — pillars of cloud by day, red and black smoke, 
and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it in pipes, 
and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a cone. You’ll be interested in that cone.’ 

‘But every now and then,’ said Raut, ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt get a burst of fire and smoke up there.’ 

‘The cone’s not fixed, it's hung by a chain from a lever, 
and balanced by an equipoise. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt shall see it nearer. 
Else, of course, thcre’d be no way of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone dips, and out comes the flare.’ 

‘1 see,’ said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. ‘The moon gets brighter,’ he said. 

‘Come along,’ said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of those swift inci- 
dents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful and reeling. Halfway across, Horrocks’ hand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he looked up the line. 
And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage windows telescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down 
186 THE CONE 

Upon them* As he grasped what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all his strength against the arm that held him back between the rails. The struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was that Horrocks held him there, so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of danger. 

‘Out of the way,’ said Horrocks, with a gasp, as the train came rattling by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks. 

‘ I did not see it coming,’ said Rant, stilf. even in spite of his own apprehension, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse. 

Horrocks answered with a grunt. ‘The cone,’ he said, 
and then, as one who recovers himself, ‘1 thought you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did not hear.’ 

‘I didn’t,’ said Raut. 

‘1 wouldn’t have had you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt run over then for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the world,’ 
said Horrocks. 

‘For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment I lost my nerve,’ said Raut. 

Horrocks stood for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the ironworks again. ‘See how fine these great mounds of mine, these clinker-heaps, look in the night! 
That truck yonder, up above there! Up it goes, and out- 
tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. 
Not that way! This way, between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the canal first.’ He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so they went along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely. 
What, he asked himself, had really happened on the line? 
Was he deluding himself with his own fancies, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt had Horrocks actually held him back in the way of the train? 
Had he just been within an ace of being murdered? 

Suppose this slouching, scowling monster did know anything? For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two then Raut was really

187 
afraid for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his life, but the mood passed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have heard nothing. At any rate, he pulled him out of the way in time. His odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before. He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. ‘High?’ said Horrocks. 

‘What?’ said Raut. ‘Rather! The haze in the moon- 
light. Fine!’ 

‘Our canal,’ said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. ‘Our canal by moonlight and firelight is an immense effect. 
You’ve never seen it? Fancy that! You’ve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle there. 1

Boiling water . . . ’ 

As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal and ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly, loud, near, and distinct. 
Three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. 
Raut felt a futile impulse to address them, and before he could frame his words, they passed into the shadows. 
Horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now: 
a weird-looking place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the furnaces. The hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it, some fifty yards up — a tumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping damply about them, an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies, a white uprising that made the head swim. The shining black tower of the larger blast- 
furnace rose overhead out of the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled their ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the water, and watched Horrocks. 

‘Here it is red,’ said Horrocks, ‘blood-red vapour as red and hot as sin; but yonder there, where the moonlight

falls on it, and it drives across the clinker-heaps, it is as while as death/ 

Fail! turned his head for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment, and then c^me back hastily to his watch on Horrocks. ‘Come along to the rolling-mills,’ said Horrocks. The threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a little reassured. 
But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean about 
‘white, as deaih’ and ‘red as sin’? Coincidence, perhaps? 

I'hey v/ent and stood behind the puddlers for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little while, and then through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate steam-hammer beat the juice oi3i <^f the succulent iron, and black, half-naked Titans rusiied the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax, between the wheels, ‘Come on,’ said Horrocks in Raut’s ear, and they went and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres, and saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnacc. It left one eye blinded for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a while. 
Then,, with green and blue patches dancing across the dark, 
they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder. 

And out upon the narrov/ rail that overhung the furnace, 
Raut’s doubts came upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did know — everything! Do what he would, he could not resist a violent trembling. Right under fool was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It w^as a dangerous place. They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the place. The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent bitter- 
ness, seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver. 
The moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds, 
half-way up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle. The steaming canal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards Burslem. 

‘That’s the cone I’ve been telling you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of,’ shouted Horrocks; ‘and, below that, sixty feet of fire and molten 
THE CONE 
189 
metal» with the air of the blast frothing through it like gas in soda-water.’ 

Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The heat was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accom- 
paniment to Horrocks’ voice. But the thing had to be gone through now. Perhaps, after all . . . 

‘In the middle,’ bawled Horrocks, ‘temperature near a thousand degrees. If you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were dropped into it . . . flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath. Why, even up here I’ve seen the rain-water boiling oflf the trucks. 
And that cone there. It’s a damned sight too hot for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt roasting cakes. The top side of it’s three hundred degrees.* 

‘Three hundred degrees!’ said Raut. 

‘Three hundred centigrade, mind!’ said Horrocks. ‘It will boil the blood out of you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in no time.’ 

‘High?’ said Raut, and turned. 

‘Boil the blood out of you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in . . . No, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t!* 

‘Let me go!’ screamed Raut. ‘Let go my arm!’ 

With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and missed, his foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted him- 
self, and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together. 

He clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it. 
A circle of glowing red appeared about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within, flickered up to- 
wards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, 
and he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black and . shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him. 
190 
THE CONE 
Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight, and shouting, ‘Fizzle, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fool! 
Fizzle, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hunter of women! you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hot-blooded hound! 
Boil! boil! boil!’ 

Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut. 

‘Horrocks!’ cried Raut. ‘Horrocks!’ 

He clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of the cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed, and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame. 

His human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had passed, Horrocks saw a charred, 
blackened figure, its head streaked with blood, still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing in agony — a cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrCus creature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek. 

Abruptly, at the sight, the ironmaster’s anger passed. 
A deadly sickness came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his nostrils. His sanity returned to him. 

‘God have mercy upon me!’ he cried. ‘O God! what have I done?’ 

He knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was already a dead man — that the blood of the poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt wretch must be boiling in his veins. An intense realization of that agony came to his mind, and overcame every otfier feeling. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment he stood irresolute, 
and then, turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud, and went radiating over the cone. 
With the thud the shriek ended, and a boiling confusion 
THE CONE 
191 
of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards him. 
As it passed, he saw the cone clear again. 

Then he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with both hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them. 

Down below was the sound of voices and running steps. 
The clangour of rolling in the shed ceased aoruptly. 
A CATASTROPHE 
The little shop was not paying. The realization came insensibly. Winslow was not the man for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt definite addition and subtraction and sudden discovery. He became aware of the truth in his mind gradually, as though it had always been there. A lot of facts had converged and led him there. There was that line of cretonnes — four half-pieces 
— untouched, save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half a yard sold to cover a stool. 
There were those shirtings at 4|d. — Bandersnatch, in the Broadway, was selling them at 2|d. — under cost, in fact- 
(Surely Bandersnatch might let a man live!) Those ser- 
vants’ caps, a selling line, needed replenishing, and that brought back the memory of Winslow’s sole wholesale dealers, Helter, Skelter, & Grab. Why! how about their account? 

Winslow stood with a big green box open on the counter before him when he thought of it. His pale grey eyes grew a little rounder; his pale, straggling moustache twitched. He had been drifting along, day' after day. 
He went round to the ramshackle cash-desk in the corner 
— ^it was Winslow’s weakness to sell his goods over the counter, give his customers a duplicate bill, and then dodge into the desk to receive the money, as though he doubted his own honesty. His lank fore-finger, with the prominent joints, ran down the bright little calendar (‘Clack’s Cottons last for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt All Time’). ‘One — ^two — three; three weeks an’ 
a day ! ’ said Winslow, staring. ‘ March ! Only three weeks and a day. It can't be.’ 

‘Tea, dear,’ said Mrs. Winslow, opening the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt with the glass window and the white blind that communicated with the parlour. 

‘One minute,’ said Winslow, and began unlocking the desk. 
A CATASTROPHE 
193 
An irritable old gentleman, very hot and red about the face, and in a heavy fur -lined coat, came in noisily. Mrs. 
Winslow vanished. 

‘UghI’ said the old gentleman. ‘Pocket-handkerchief.’ 

‘Yes, sir,’ said Winslow. ‘About what price ’ 

‘Ugh!’ said the old gentleman. ‘Poggit-handkerchief, 
quig!’ 

Winslow began to feel flustered. He produced two boxes. 

‘These, sir ’ began Winslow. 

‘ Sheed tin!’ said the old gentleman, clutching the stiffness of the linen. ‘Wad to blow my nose — not haggit about.’ 

‘A cotton one, p’raps, sir?’ said Winslow. 

‘How much?’ said the old gentleman over the hand- 
herchief. 

‘Sevenpence, sir. There’s nothing more I can show you? No ties, braces ?’ 

‘Damn!’ said the old gentleman, fumbling in his ticket- 
pocket, and finally producing half a crown. Winslow looked round for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his metallic duplicate-book which he kept in various fixtures, according to circumstances, and then he caught the old gentleman’s eye. He went straight to the desk at once and got the change, with an entire disregard of the routine of the shop. 

Winslow was always more or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt less excited by a customer. 
But the open desk reminded him of his trouble. It did not come back to him. all at once. He heard a finger-nail softly tapping on the glass, and, looking up, saw Minnie’s eyes over the blind. It seemed like retreat opening. He shut and locked the desk, and went into the back room to tea. 

But he was preoccupied. Three weeks and a day! He took unusually large bites of his bread and butter, and stared hard at the little pot of jam. He answered Minnie’s conversational advances distractedly. The shadow of Helter, Skelter, & Grab lay upon the tea-table. He was 
IM A CATASTROPHE 

Struggling with this new idea of failure, the tangible realiza- 
tion that was taking shape and substance, condensing, as it were, out of the misty uneasiness of many days. At present it was simply one concrete fact; there were thirty- 
nine pounds left in the bank, and that day three weeks Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & Grab, those enterprising out- 
fitters of young men, would demand their eighty pounds. 

After tea there was a customer or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so — small purchases: 
some muslin and buckram, dress -protectors, tape, and a pair of lisle hose. Then, knowing that Black Care was lurking in the dusky corners of the shop, he lit the three lamps early and set to, refolding his cotton prints, the most vigorous and least meditative proceeding of which he could think. He could see Minnie’s shadow in the other room as she moved about the table. She was busy turning an old dress. He had a walk after supper, looked in at the Y.M.C.A., but found no one to talk to, and finally went to bed. Minnie was already there. And there, too, 
waiting for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him, nudging him gently, until about midnight he was hopelessly i^ake, sat Black Care. 

He had had one or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two nights lately in that company, 
but this was much worse. First came Messrs. Helter, 
Skelter, & Grab, and their demands for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt eighty pounds — an enormous sum when your original capital was only a hundred and seventy. They camped, as it were, before him, sat down and beleaguered him. He clutched feebly at the circumambient darkness for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt expedients. Suppose he had a sale, sold things for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt almost anything? He tried to imagine a sale miraculously successful in some unexpected manner, and mildly profitable, in spite of reductions below cost. Then Bandersnatch Limited, 101, 102, 103, 105, 
106, 107, Broadway, joined the siege, a long caterpillar of frontage, a battery of shop fronts, wherein things were sold at a farthing above cost. How could he fight such an establishment? Besides, what had he to sell? He began to review his resources. What taking line was there to bait 
A CATASTROPHE 
195 
the sale? Then straightway came those pieces of cretonne, 
yellow and black, with a bluish-green flower; those dis- 
credited skirtings, prints without buoyancy, skirmishing haberdashery, some despairful four -button gloves by an inferior https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt maker — a hopeless crew. And that was his force against Bandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, & Grab, and the pitiless world behind them. Whatever had made him think a mortal would buy such things? Why had he bought this and neglected that? He suddenly realized the intensity of his hatred for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Helter, Skelter, & Grab’s salesman. Then he drove towards an agony of self-reproach. He had spent too much on that cash-desk. What real need was there of a desk? He saw his vanity of that desk in a lurid glow of self-discovery. And the lamps? Five pounds! Then suddenly, with what was almost physical pain, he remem- 
bered the rent. 

He groaned and turned over. And there, dim in the darkness, was the hummock of Mrs. Winslow’s shoulder. 
That set him off in another direction. He became acutely sensible of Minnie’s want of feeling. Here he was, worried to death about business, and she sleeping like a little ghild. 
He regretted having married, with that infinite bitterness that only comes to the human heart in the small hours of the morning. That hummock of white seemed absolutely without helpfulness, a burden, a responsibility. What fools men were to marry! Minnie’s inert repose irritated him so much that he was almost provoked to wake her up and ^ 
tell her that they were ‘Ruined.’ She would have to go back to her uncle; her uncle had always been against him: 
and as for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his own future, Winslow was exceedingly un- 
certain. A shop assistant who has once set up for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt himself finds the utmost difficulty in getting into a situation again. 
He began to figure himself ‘crib-hunting’ once more, going from this wholesale house to that, writing innumerable letters. How he hated writing letters! ‘Sir, — Referring to your advertisement in the Christian World,^ He beheld 
196 A CATASTROPHE 

an infinite vista of discotnfort and disappointment, ending 
— ^in a gulf. 

He dressed, yawning, and went down to open the shop. 
He felt tired before the day began. As he carried the shutters in, he kept asking himself what good he was doing. The end was inevitable, whether he bothered or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt not. The clear daylight smote into the place, and showed how old and rough and splintered was the floor, how shabby the second-hand counter, how hopeless the whole enterprise. He had been dreaming these past six months of a bright shop, of a happy couple, of a modest but comely profit flowing in. He had suddenly awakened from his dream. The braid that bound his decent black coat — it was a trifle loose — caught against the catch of the shop door, and was torn away. This, suddenly turned his wretchedness to wrath. He stood quivering for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment, 
then, with a spiteful clutch, tore the braid looser, and went ih to Minnie. 

‘Here,’ he said, with infinite reproach; ‘look here! you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt might look after a chap a bit.’ 

‘ I didn’t see it was tom,’ said Minnie. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt never do,’ said Winslow, with gross injustice, 
' until things are too late.’ 

Minnie looked suddenly at his face. ‘I’ll sew it now, 
Sid, if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like.’ 

‘Let’s have breakfast first,’ said Winslow, ‘and do things at their proper time.’ 

He was preoccupied at breakfast, and Minnie watched him anxiously. His only remark was to declare his egg a bad one. It wasn’t; it was flavoury — being one of those at fifteen a shilling, — ^but quite nice. He pushed it away from him, and then, having eaten a slice of bread and butter, admitted himself in the wrong by resuming the egg. 

‘Sid,’ said Minnie, as he stood up to go into the shop again, ‘you’re not well.’ 
A CATASTROPHE 
197 
‘Fm well enough.’ He looked at her as though he hated her. 

‘Then there’s something else the matter. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt aren’t angry with me, Sid, are you, about that braid? Do tell me what’s the matter. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were just like this at tea yesterday, and at supper-time. It wasn’t the braid then.’ 

‘And I’m likely to be.’ 

She looked interrogation. ’Oh, what is the matter?’ 
she said. 

It was too good a chance to miss, and he brought the evil news out with dramatic force. ‘ Matter? ’ he said. ‘ I done ray best, and here we are. That’s the matter! If I can’t pay Helter, Skelter, & Grab eighty pounds, this day three 

weeks ’ Pause. ‘We shall be sold up! Sold up! 

That’s the matter, Min ! Sold up ! ’ 

‘Oh, Sid!’ began Minnie. 

He slammed the door. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the moment he felt relieved of at least half his misery. He began dusting boxes that did not require dusting, and then rcblocked a cretonne already faultlessly blocked. He was in a state of grim wretchedness; a martyr under the harrow of fate. At any rate, it should not be said he failed for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt want of industry. 
And how he had planned and contrived and worked! All to this end! He felt horrible doubts. Providence and Bandersnatch — surely they were incompatible! Perhaps he was being ‘tried’? That sent him off upon a new tack, 
a very comforting one. The martyr pose, the gold-in-the- 
furnace attitude, lasted all the morning. 

At dinner — ‘potato pie’ — ^he looked up suddenly, and saw Minnie’s face regarding him. Pale she looked, and a little red about the eyes. Something caught him suddenly with a queer effect upon his throat. All his thoughts seemed to wheel round into quite a new direction. 

He pushed back his plate and stared at her blankly. 
Then he got up, went round the table to her— she staring 
198 
A CATASTROPHE 
at him. He dropped on his knees beside her without a word. ‘Oh, Minnie!’ he said, and suddenly she knew it was peace, and put her arms about him, as he began to sob and weep. 

He cried like a little boy, slobbering on her shoulder that he was a knave to have married her and brought her to this, that he hadn’t the wits to be trusted with a penny, 
that it was all his fault, that he ^had hoped so " — ending in a howl. And she, crying gently herself, patting his shoulders, said "Ssh!" softly to his noisy weeping, and so soothed the outbreak. Then suddenly the crazy bell upon the shop door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt began, and Winslow had to jump to his feet, and be a man again. 

After that scene they ‘talked it over’ at tea, at supper, 
in bed, at every possible interval in between, solemnly — 
quite inconclusively — with set faces and eyes for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part staring in front of them — and yet with a certain mutual comfort. ‘What to do I don’t know,’ was Win- 
slow’s main proposition. Minnie tried to take a cheerful view of service — with a probable baby. But she found she needed all her courage. And her uncle would help her again, perhaps, just at the critical time. It didn’t do for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt folks to be too proud. Besides, ‘something might happen,’ 
a favourite formula with her. 

One hopeful line w^as to anticipate a sudden afiSux of customers. ‘Perhaps,’ said Minnie, ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt might get together fifty. They know you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt well enough to trust you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a bit.’ They debated that point. Once the possibility of Helter, Skelter, & Grab giving credit was admitted, it was pleasant to begin sweating the acceptable minimum. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some half-hour over tea the second day after Winslow’s discoveries they were quite cheerful again, laughing even at their terrific fears. Even twenty pounds to go on with might be considered enough. Then in some mysterious way the pleasant prospect of Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & 
Grab tempering the wind to the shorn retailer vanished — 
A CATASTROPHE 
199 
vanished absolutely, and Winslow found himself again in the pit of despair. 

He began looking about at the furniture, and wondering idly what it would fetch. The chiffonier was good, any- 
how, and there were Minnie’s old plates that her mother used to have. Then he began to think of desperate expedients for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt putting off the evil day. He had heard somewhere of Bills of Sale — there was to his ears something comfortingly substantial in the phrase. Then, why not 
‘Go to the Money-Lenders’? 

One cheering thing happened on Thursday afternoon a little girl came in with a pattern of ‘print,’ and he was able to match it. He had not been able to match anything out of his meagre stock before. He went in and told Minnie. The incident is mentioned lest the reader should imagine it was uniform despair wath him. 

The next morning, and the next, after the discovery. 
Winslow opened shop late. When one has been awake most of the night, and has no hope, what is the good of getting up punctually? But as he went into the dark shop on Friday he saw something lying on the floor, 
something lit by the bright light that came under the ill- 
fitting door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt — a black oblong. He stooped and picked up an envelope with a deep mourning edge. It was addressed to his wife. Clearly a death in her family — perhaps her uncle. He knew the man too well to have expectations. 
And they would have to get mourning and go to the funeral. 
The brutal cruelty of people dying! He saw it all in a flash— he always visualized his thoughts. Black trousers to get, black crape, black gloves — none in stock — the railway fares, the shop closed for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the day. 

‘I’m afraid there’s bad news, Minnie,’ he said. 

She was kneeling before the fireplace, blowing the fire. 
She had her housemaid’s gloves on and the old country sun-bonnet she wore of a morning, to keep the dust out 
200 
A CATASTROPHE 
of her hair. She turned, saw the envelope, gave a gasp, 
and pressed two bloodless lips together. 

‘I’m afraid it’s uncle,’ she said, holding the letter and staring with eyes wide open into Winslow’s face. ^Ifs a strange hand!' 

‘The postmark’s Hull,’ said Winslow. 

‘The postmark’s Hull.’ 

Minnie opened the letter slowly, drew it out, hesitated, 
turned it over, saw the signature. ‘It’s Mr. Speight I’ 

‘What does he say?’ said Winslow. 

Minnie began to read. ‘O/i/’ she screamed. She dropped the letter, collapsed into a crouching heap, her hands covering her eyes. Winslow snatched at it. ‘A 
.most terrible accident has occurred,’ he read; ‘Melchior’s chimney fell down yesterday evening right on the top of your uncle’s house, and every living soul was killed — your uncle, your cousin Mary, Will and Ned, and the girl — every one of them, and smashed — ^you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would hardly know them. 
I’m writing to you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to break the news before you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see it 

in the papers ’ The letter fluttered from Winslow’s 

fingers. He put out his hand against the mantel to steady himself. 

All of them dead ! Then he saw, as in a vision, a row of seven cottages, each let at seven shillings a week, a timber yard, two villas, and the ruins — still marketable — of the avuncular residence. He tried to feel a sense of loss and could not. They were sure to have been left to Minnie’s aunt. All dead! 7 x 7 x 52 20 began insensibly 

to work itself out in his mind, but discipline was ever weak in his mental arithmetic; figures kept moving from one line to another, like children playing at Widdy, Widdy Way. Was it two hundred pounds about— or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt one hundred pounds? Presently he picked up the letter again, and finished reading it. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt being the next of kin,’ said Mr. Speight. 

‘How awful r said Minnie in a horror-struck whisper, 
A CATASTROPHE 
201 
and looking up at last. Winslow stared back at her, 
shaking his head solemnly. There were a thousand things running through his mind, but none that, even to his dull sense, seemed appropriate as a remark. ‘ It was the Lord’s will,’ he said at last. 

‘It seems so very, very terrible,’ said Minnie, ‘auntie, 
dear auntie — Ted — poor, dear uncle ’ 

‘It was the Lord’s will, Minnie,’ said Winslow, with infinite feeling. A long silence. 

‘Yes,’ said Minnie, very slowly, staring thoughtfully at the crackling black paper in the grate. The fire had gone out. “Yes, perhaps it was the Lord’s will.’ 

They looked gravely at one another. Each would have been terribly shocked at any mention of the property by the other. She turned to the dark fireplace and began tearing up an old newspaper slowly. Whatever our losses may be, the world’s work still waits for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt us, Winslow gave a deep sigh and walked in a hushed manner towards the front door. As he opened it, a flood of sunlight came streaming into the dark shadows of the closed shop. 
Bandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, & Grab, had vanished out of his mind like the mists before the rising sun. 

Presently he was carrying in the shutters, and in the briskest way, the fire in the kitchen was crackling exhilara- 
tingly, with a little saucepan walloping above it, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Minnie was boiling two eggs — one for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt herself this morning, as well as one for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him — and Minnie herself v/as audible, 
laying breakfast with the greatest eclat. The blow was a sudden and terrible one — but it behoves us to face such tilings bravely in this sad, unaccountable world. It was quite midday before either of them mentioned the cottages. 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
Outside the laboratory windows was a watery-grey fog- 
and within a close warmth and the yellow light of the green - 
shaded gas lamps that stood two to each table down its narrow length. On each table stood a couple of glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels, 
frogs, and guinea-pigs upon which the students had been working, and down the side of the room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing bleached dissections in spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed anatomical drawings in whitewood frames and overhanging a row of cubical lockers. All the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard, and on these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous day’s work. The laboratory was empty, save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the demonstrator, who sat near the preparation -room door, and silent, save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a low, continuous murmur, and the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working. But scattered about the room were traces of numerous students: hand-bags, 
polished boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing covered by newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of News from Nowhere ^ a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These things had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the closed door, the measured accents of the professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sounded as a featureless muttering. 

Presently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the Oratory clock striking the hour of eleven. 
The clicking of the microtome ceased, and the demonstrator https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt looked at his w^atch, rose, thrust his hands into his pockets, 
and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre door. He stood listening for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment, and then 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 203 

his eye fell on the little volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled, opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer ceased, there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the lecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of voices speaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which began to open, and stood ajar as some indistinctly heard question arrested the new-comer. 

The demonstrator https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt turned, walked slowly back past the microtome, and left the laboratory by the preparation - 
room door. As he did so, first one, and then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt stood in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally heterogeneous assembly, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from the blushing pros- 
pect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated America in the matter years ago — mixed socially too, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the prestige of the College is high, and its scholarships, 
free of any age limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch universities. The class numbered one-and- 
twenty, but some remained in the theatre questioning the professor, copying the blackboard diagrams before they were washed off, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the day’s teaching. Of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman wearing spectacles and dressed in greyish -green, was peering out of the window at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking, plain- 
raced schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their places, one a pallid, dark- 
bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other a pleasant -featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a 
204 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

well -fitting brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn the eye specialist. The others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a dwarfed, 
spectacled figure with a hunch back, sar on a bent wood stool; two others, one a short, dark youngster and the other a flaxen-haired, rcddish-complexioned young man, 
stood leaning side by side against the slate sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger share of the conversation. 

This last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow, of the same age as Wedderburn; he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of an indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features. He talked rather louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply into his pockets. His collar w^as frayed and blue with the starch of a careless laundress, his clothes were evidently ready-made, and there was a patch on the side of his boot near the toe. And as he talked or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt listened to the others, 
he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door. They were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just heard, the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology. ‘From ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata,’ the lecturer had said in his melancholy tones, and so had neatly rounded oflf the sketch of comparative anatomy he had been developing. 
The spectacled hunchback had repeated it with noisy appreciation, had tossed it towards the fair-haired student with an evident provocation, and had started one of those vague, rambling discussions on generalities so un- 
accountably dear to the student mind all the world over. 

‘That is our goal, perhaps — I admit it, as far as science goes,’ said the fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. 
‘But there are things above scier^ce.’ 

‘Science,’ said Hill confidently, ‘is systematic knowledge. 
Ideas that don’t come into the system— must anyhow — 
be loose ideas.’ He was not quite sure whether that 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 205 

was a clever saying or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a fatuity until his hearers took it seriously. 

‘The thing I cannot understand,’ said the hunchback, at large, ‘is whether Hill is a materialist or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nbt.’ 

‘There is one thing above matter,’ said Hil! promptly, 
feeling he made a better point this time, aware, too, of someone in the doorway behind him, and raising his voice a trifle for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt her benefit, ‘and that is, the delusion that there is something above matter.’ 

‘So w'c have your gospel at last,’ said the fair student. 

‘ It’s all a delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead some- 
thing more than dogs’ lives, all our work for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt anything beyond ourselves. But see how inconsistent you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are. Your socialism, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance. Why do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt trouble about the interests of the race? Why do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt concern yourself about the beggar in the gutter? Why are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt bothering yourself to lend that book’ — he indicated William Morris by a movement of the head — ‘to everyone in the lab?’ 

‘Girl,’ said the hunchback indistinctly, and glanced guiltily over his shoulder. 

The girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory, and stood on the other side of the table behind him, with her roUed-up apron in one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the discussion. She did not notice the hunchback, because she was glancing from Hill to his interlocutor. Hill’s consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her only in his studious ignoring of the fact; but she understood that, and it pleased her. ‘I see no reason,’ said he, ‘why a man should live like a brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter, and does not expect to exist a hundred years hence.’ 

‘Why shouldn’t he?’ said the fair-haired student. 

‘Why^/iowWhe?’said Hill. 

‘What inducement has he?’ 

‘That’s the way with all you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt religious people. It’s ail 
206 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

a business of inducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt righteousness’ sake?’ 

There was a pause. The fair man answered, with a kind of vocal padding, ‘But — ^you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sec — inducement — when I said inducement,’ to gain time. And then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question. He was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions, and they invariably took one form — a demand for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a definition. 
‘What’s your definition of righteousness?’ said the hunch- 
back at this stage. 

Hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question, but even as it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the laboratory attendant, who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number of freshly killed guinea-pigs by their hind legs. ‘This is the last batch of material this season,’ said the youngster who had not previously spoken. Brooks advanced up the laboratory, 
smacking down a couple of guinea-pigs at each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice of a specimen. 
There was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out. HiU was already standing by his table, and his box of scalpels was sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him, and leaning over his table said softly, 
‘ Did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see that I returned your book, Mr. Hill?’ 

During the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his consciousness; but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and seeing it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time. 
‘Oh yes,’ he said, taking it up. ‘I see. Did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like it?’ 

‘I want to ask you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some questions about it — some lime.’ 

‘Certainly,’ said Hill. ‘I shall be glad.’ He stopped awkwardly. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt liked it?’ he said. 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 207 

'It’s a wonderful book. Only some things I don’t understand.’ 

Then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious braying noise. It was the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day’s instruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway between the ‘Er’ of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. 
The girl in brown slipped back to her place: it was imme- 
diately in front of Hill’s, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, 
took a notebook out of the drawer of his table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy pencil from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious note of the coming demonstration. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt demonstrations and lectures arc the sacred text of the College students. Books, saving only the Professor’s own, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may — it is even expedient to — ignore. 

Hill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical College. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week, and found that, with proper care, this also covered his clothing allowance, an occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles and cotton and such-like necessaries for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a man about town. This was his first year and his first session, but the brown old man in Landport had already got himself detested in many public-houses by boasting of his son, ‘the Professor.’ Hill was a vigorous youngster, 
with a serene contempt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the clergy of all denominations, 
and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world. He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity. He had begun to read at seven, and had read steadily whatever came in his way, good or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt bad, since then. His worldly experience had been limiied to the island of Portsea, and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day, after passing the seventh standard of the Board school. He had a considerable gift of speech, as the College Debating Society, which met amidst the crushing 
208 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

machi^ and mine models in the metallurgical theatre already recognized-recognized by a violent baltering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a broad valley at one’s feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and tremendous achieve- 
ments. And his own limitations, save that he knew that he knew neither Latin nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt French, were all unknown to him. 

At first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his biological work at the College and social and theological theorising, an employment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big museum library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room in Chelsea with his coat and a mufl3er on, and write out the lecture notes and revise his dissection memoranda until Thorpe called him out by a whistle — the landlady objected to open the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to attic visitors— and then the two would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit streets, 
(talking, very much in the fashion of the sample just given, 
of the God Idea and Righteousness and Carlyle and the Reorganization of Society. And in the midst of it all. 
Hill, arguing not only for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Thorpe but for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the casual passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him ts he passed. Science and Righteousness! But once or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt twice lately there had been signs that a third interest was creeping into his life, and he had found his attention wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the probable meaning of the blastopore, to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat at the table before him. 

She was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes to speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had, and the accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became abject within him. 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 209 

She had spoken to him fiist over a difficulty about the alisphenoid of a rabbit’s skull, and he had found that, in biology at least, he had no reason for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt self-abasement. 
And from that, after the manner of young people starting from any starting-point, they got to generalities, and while Hill attacked her upon the question of socialism, — some instinct told him to spare her a direct assault upon her religion — she was gathering resolution to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education. She was a year or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two older than he, though the thought never occurred to him. The loan of News from Nowhere was the beginning of a series of cross loans. Upon some absurd first principle of his, Hill had never ‘wasted time’ 
upon poetry, and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her. One day in the lunch hour, when she chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the skeletons were arranged, shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday meal, she retreated, and returned to lend him, 
with a slightly furtive air, a volume of Browning. He stood sideways towards her and took the book rather clumsily, because he was holding the bun in the other hand. And in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful clearness he could have wished. 

That occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy, on the day before the College turned out its students and was carefully locked up by the officials for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Christmas holidays. The excitement of cramming for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first trial of strength had for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little while dominated Hill to the exclusion of his other interests. In the fore- 
casts of the result in which everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a possible competitor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Harvey Commemoration Medal, of which this and the two subsequent examinations disposed. 
It was about this time that Wedderburn, who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin of Hill’s perceptions, began to take on the appearance of an obstacle. 
210 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

By a mutual agreement, the nocturnal prowlings with Thorpe ceased for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the three weeks before the examination, 
and his landlady pointed out that she really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price. He walked to and fro from the College with little slips of mnemonics in his hand, lists of crayfish appendages, rabbits’ skull-bones, and vertebrate nerves, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt example, and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite direction. 

But, by a natural reaction, Poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled the Christmas holiday. The pending results of the examination became such a secondary con- 
sideration that Hill marvelled at his father's excitement. 
Even had he washed it, there was no comparative anatomy to read in Landport, and he was too poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt to buy books, but the stock of poets in the library was exten- 
sive, and Hill’s attack was magnificently sustained. He saturated himself with the fluent numbers of Longfellow and Tennyson, and fortified himself with Shakespeare; 
found a kindred soul in Pope and a master in Shelley, 
and heard and fled the siren voices of Eliza Cook and Mrs. Hemans. But he read no more Browning, because he hoped for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the loan of other volumes from Miss Haysman when he returned to London. 

He walked from his lodgings to the College with that volume of Browning in his shiny black bag, and his mind teeming with the finest general propositions about poetry. 
Indeed, he framed first this little speech and then that with which to grace the return. The morning was an exceptionally pleasant one for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt London; there was a clear hard fro.st and undeniable blue in the sky, a thin haze softened every outline, and warm shafts of sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the street to amber and gold. In the hall of the College he pulled off his glove and signed his name with fingers so stijBf with cold that the characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a quivering line. He 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 211 

imagined Miss Haysman about him everywhere. He turned at the staircase, and there, below, he saw a crowd struggling at the foot of the notice-board. This, possibly, was the biology list. He forgot Browning and Miss Haysman for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the moment, and joined the scrimmage. And at last, with his cheek flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step above him, he read the list — 

CLASS I 

H. J. Somers Wedderburn 

William Hill 

and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present sympathies. Tt was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Thorpe on the physics list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and in a curious emotional state between pride over common second-class humanity and acute disappointment at Wedderburn’s success, went on his way upstairs. At the top, as he was hanging up his coat in the passage, the zoological demonstrator, a young man from Oxford who secretly regarded him as a blatant ‘mugger’ of the very worst type, offered his heartiest congratulations. 

At the laboratory door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Hill slopped for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a second to gel his breath, and then entered. He looked straight up the laboratory and saw ail five girl students grouped in their places, and Wedderburn, the once retiring Wedder- 
burn, leaning rather gracefully against the window, playing with the blind tassel and talking apparently to the five of them. Now, Hill could talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl, and he could have made a speech to a roomful of girls, but this business of standing at ease and appreciating, fencing, and returning quick remarks round a group was, he knew, altogether beyond him. 
Coming up the staircase his feelings for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Wedderburn had been generous, a certain admiration perhaps, a willingness 
212 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

to shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the first round. But before Christmas Wedderburn had never gone up to that end of the room to talk. In a flash Hill’s mist of vague excitement con- 
densed abruptly to a vivid dislike of Wedderburn. Possibly his expression clianged. As he came up to his place, 
Wedderburn nodded carelessly to him, and the others glanced round. Miss Haysman looked at him and away again, the faintest touch of her eyes. ‘ I can’t agree with you, Mr. Wedderburn,’ she said. 

‘I must congratulate you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt on your first c^ass, Mr. Hill,’ 
said the spectacled girl in green, turning round and beaming at him. 

‘It’s nothing,’ said Hill, staring at Wedderburn and Miss 
-Haysman talking together, and eager to hear what they talked about. 

‘We poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt folks in the second class don’t think so,’ said the girl in spectacles. 

What was it Wedderburn was saying? Something about William Morris! Hill did not answer the girl in spectacles, 
and the smile died out of his face. He could not hear, 
and failed to see how he could ‘cut in.’ Confound Wedder- 
burn! He sat down, opened his bag, hesitated whether to return the volume of Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and instead drew out his new notebooks for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the short course in elementary botany that was now beginning, 
and which would terminate in February. As he did so, 
a fat heavy man with a white face and pale grey eyes— 
Bindon, the professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of botany, who came up from Kew for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt January and February — came in by the lecture theatre door, and passed, rubbing his hands together and smiling, 
in silent affability down the laboratory. 

In the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some very rapid and curiously complex emotional developments. 
For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part he had Wedderburn in focus — a fact 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 213 

that Miss Haysman never suspected. She told Hill (for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of socialism and Browning and general propositions) that she had met Wedderburn at the house of some people she knew, and ‘he’s inherited his cleverness; 
for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his father, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, is the great eye specialist.’ 

"My father is a cobbler,’ said Hill, quite irrelevantly, 
and perceived the want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of jealousy did not offend her. She conceived herself the fundamental source of it. He suffered bitterly from a sense of Wedderburn’s unfairness, and a realization of his own handicap. Here was this Wedderburn had picked up a prominent man for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a father, and instead of his losing so many marks on the score of that advantage, it was counted to him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt righteousness! And while Hill had to introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman clumsily over mangled guinea-pigs in the laboratory, this Wedderburn, 
in some backstairs way, had access to her social altitudes, 
and could converse in a polished argot that Hill under- 
stood perhaps, but felt incapable of speaking. Not, of course, that he wanted to. Then it seemed to Hill that for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Wedderburn to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed, neatly tailored, precisely barbered, quietly per- 
fect, was in itself an ill-bred, sneering sort of proceeding. 
Moreover, it was a stealthy thing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Wedderburn to behave insignificantly for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a space, to mock modesty, to lead Hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year, and then suddenly to dart in front of him, 
and incontinently to swell up in this fashion. In addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an increasing dis- 
position to join in any conversational grouping that included Miss Haysman; and would venture, and indeed seek occasion, to pass opinions derogatory to socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities by neat, shallow, 
and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders, until Hill hated Bernard Shaw’s graceful egotisms, 
214 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

William Morris’s limited editions and luxurious wall- 
papers, and Walter Crane’s charmingly absurd ideal working men, about as much as he hated Wedderburn. 
The dissertations in the laboratory, that had been his glory in the previous term, became a danger, degenerated into inglorious tussles with Wedderburn, and Hill kept to them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved. In the debating society Hill knew quite clearly that, to a thunderous accompaniment of banged desks, he could have pulverized Wedderburn. Only Wedderburn never attended the debating society to be pulverized, because — nauseous affectation!— he 'dined late.’ 

you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must not imagine that these things presented them- 
selves in quite such a crude form to Hill’s perception. 
Hill was a born generalizer. Wedderburn to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type, the salient angle of a class. The economic theories that, after infinite ferment, had shaped themselves in Hill’s mind, became abruptly concrete at the contact. The world became full of easy-mannered, graceful, gracefully-dressed, conversa- 
tionally dexterous, finally shallow Wedderburn’s, Bishops Wedderburn, Wedderburn M.P.s, Professors Wedderburn, 
'Wedderburn landlords, all with finger-bowl shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of refuge from a sturdy debater. And everyone ill -clothed or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ill-dressed, from the cobbler to the cab-runner, was, to Hill’s imagination, a man and a brother, a fellow-sufferer. So that he became, as it w'ere, a champion of the fallen and oppressed, albeit to outward seeming only a self-assertive, ill-mannered young man, and an unsuccessful champion at that. Again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the girl students had inaugurated left Hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered temper, and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic bitterness in his speeches. 

you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will understand now how it was necessary, if only in the interests of humanity, that Hill should demolish 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 215 

Wedderburn in the forthcoming examination and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman; and you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will perceive, 
too, how Miss Haysman fell into some common feminine misconceptions. The Hill -Wedderburn quarrel, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in his unostentatious way Wedderburn reciprocated Hill’s ill- 
veiled rivalry, became a tribute to her indefinable charm; 
she was the Queen of Beauty in a tournament of scalpels and stumpy pencils. To her confidcinial friend’s secret annoyance, it even troubled her conscience, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt she was a good girl, and painfully aware, through Ruskin and contemporary fiction, how entirely men’s activities are determined by women’s attitudes. And if Hill never by any chance mentioned the topic of love to her, she oniv credited him with the finer modesty for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that omission. 

So the lime came on for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the second examination, and Hill’s increasing pallor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt confirmed the gene.ral rumour that he was working hard. In the Aerated Bread shop near South Kensington Station you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would see him, breaking his bun and sipping his milk with his eyes intent upon a paper of closely written notes. In his bedroom there were propositions about buds and stems round his looking- 
glass, a diagram to catch bis eye, if soap should chance to spare it, above his washing basin. He missed several meetings of the debating society, but he found the chance encounters with Miss Haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent art museum, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in the little museum at the top of the College, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in the College corridors, more fre- 
quent and very restful. In particular, they used to meet in a little gallery full of wrought-iron chests and gates near the art library, and there Hill used to talk, under the gentle stimulus of her flattering attention, of Browning and his personal ambitions. A characteristic she found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice. He contemplated quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income below a hundred pounds a year. But he was determined to be famous, to make, recognizably 
216 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

in his own proper person, the world a better place to live in. He took Bradlaugh and John Burns for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his leaders and models, poor, even impecunious, great men. 
But Miss Haysrnan thought that such lives were deficient on the aesthetic side, by which, though she did not know it, she meant good wall-paper and upholstery, pretty books, 
tasteful clothes, concerts, and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served. 

At last came the day of the second examination, and the professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of botany, a fussy, conscientious man, re-arranged all the tables in a long narrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt on a chair on a table 
(where he felt, be said, like a Hindoo god), to see all the cheating, and stuck a notice outside the door, ‘Door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt closed,' for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt no earthly reason that any human being could discover. And all the morning from ten till one the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance at Hill’s, and the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack, 
and so also it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a little quieter than usual, and Hill’s face was hot all day, 
and his overcoat bulged with textbooks and notebooks against the last moment’s revision. .And the next day, in the morning and in the afternoon, was the practical examination, v/hen sections had to be cut and slides identi- 
fied. In the morning Hill was depressed because he knew he had cut a thick section, and in the afternoon came the mysterious slip. 

It was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was always doing. Like the income tax, it offered a premium to the cheat. It was a preparation under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its place on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips, and the inscription set forth that the slip was not to be moved. Each student was to go in turn to it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what he considered it to be, and return to his place. Now, to move such a slip is a thing one can do 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
217 
by a chance movement of the finger, and in a fraction of a second. The professor’s reason for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt decreeing that the slip should not be moved depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was characteristic of a certain tree stem. In the position in which it was placed it was a diflScult thing to recognize, but once the slip was moved so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view, 
its nature was obvious enough. 

Hill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining re-agents, sat down on the little stool before the micro- 
scope, turned the mirror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 1o get the best light, and then, 
out of sheer habit, shifted the slip. At once he remem- 
bered the prohibition, and, with an almost continuous motion of his hands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his action. 

Then, slowly, he turned his head. The pi ofessor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt was out of the room; the demonstrator https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the Q. Jour, Mi. Sci.: the rest of the examinees were busy, and with their backs to him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite clearly what the thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation from the cider-tree. His eyes roved over his intent fellow-students and Wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his eyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these two days gave v/ay to a curious nervous tension. His book of answers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but with one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His mind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon him. Should he identify it? or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt should be leave this question unanswered? 
In that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the second result. How could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing without shifting it? 
It was possible that Wedderburn had failed to recognize 
218 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide? He looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to make up his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat. 

He read through his manuscript, and then sat thinking and gnawing his knuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He must beat Wedderburn. He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns and Brad- 
laugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse of the rest of the slip he had had was after all quite accidental, forced upon him by chance, a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage. It was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of Broome, 
who believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a first-class. *Five minutes more,’ said the demonstrator, 
folding up his paper and becoming observant. Hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained; then he opened the book of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation of case, gave his drawing of the lenticeJ its name. 

When the second pass list appeared, the previous positions of Wedderburn and Hill were reversed, and the spectacled girl in green, who knew the demonstrator https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in private life 
(where he was practically human), said that in the result of the two examinations taken together Hill had the advan- 
tage of a mark — 167 to 166 out of a possible 200. Every- 
one admired Hill in a way, though the suspicion of mugging’ clung to him. But Hill was to find congratula- 
tions and Miss Haysman’s enhanced opinion of him, and even the decided decline in the crest of Wedderburn, 
tainted by an unhappy memory. He felt a remarkable access of energy at first, and the note of a democracy marching to triumph returned to his debating society speeches; he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and effect, and he went on with his eesthetic education. But through it all, a vivid little picture 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 219 

was continually coming before his mind’s eye — of a sncakish person manipulating a slide. 

No human being had witnessed the act, and he was cocksure that no higher power existed to see it; but for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all that it worried him. Memories are not dead things, 
but alive; they dwindle in disuse, but they harden and develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being con- 
tinually fretted. Curiously enough, though at the time he perceived clearly that the shifting was accidental, as the days wore on his memory became confused about it, 
until at last he was not sure — although he assured himself that he was sure — whether the movement had been abso- 
lutely involuntary. Then it is possible that Hill’s dietary was conducive to morbid conscientiousness; a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry, a midday bun, and, at such hours after five as chance to be convenient, such meat as his means determined, usually in a chop-house in a back street off the Brompton Road. Occasionally he treated himself to threepenny or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ninepenny classics, and they usually represented a suppression of potatoes or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt chops. 
It is indisputable that outbreaks of self-abasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to periods of scarcity. But apart from this influence on the feelings, 
there was in Hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the blasphemous Landport cobbler had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years. Of one fact about professed atheists I am convinced; they may be — they usually are — fools, void of subtlety, revilers of holy institu- 
tions, brutal speakers, and mischievous knaves, but they lie with difficulty. If it were not so, if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise, they would simply be liberal churchmen. And, moreover, this memory poisoned his regard for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Miss Haysinan. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt she now so evidently preferred him to Wedderbum that he felt sure he cared for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt her, and began reciprocating her attentions by timid marks of personal regard; at one time he even bought 
m A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

buDtJ) of violets, carried it about in his pocket, and pro- 
duced it with a stumbling explanation, withered and dead, 
in the gallery of old iron. It poisoned, too, the denun- 
ciation of capitalist dishonesty that had been one of his life's pleasures. And, lastly, it poisoned his triumph in We-dderburn. Previously he had been Wedderburn’s superior https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in liis own eyes, and had raged simply at a want of recognition. Now he began to fret at the darker suspicion of positive inferiority. He fancied he found justifications for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his position in Browning, but they vanished on analysis. At last — moved, curiously enough, by exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty 
— be went to Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Bindon, and made a clean breast of the whole affair. As Hill was a paid student, Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Bindon did not ask him to sit down, and he stood before the professor’s desk as he made his confession. 

'It’s a curious story,’ said Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Bindon, slowly realizing how the thing reflected on himself, and then letting his anger rise— ‘A most remarkable story. I can’t understand your doing it, and I can’t understand this avowal. You’re a type of student — Cambridge men would 

never dream— I suppose I ought to have thought 

Why did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cheat?’ 

‘I didn’t cheat,’ said Hill. 

'But you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have just been telling me you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did.’ 

* I thought 1 explained ’ 

‘Either you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cheated or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did not cheat ’ 

* 1 said my motion was involuntary.’ 

‘ I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of science — of fact. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were told not to move the slip. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did move the slip. If that is not cheating ’ 

‘If I was a cheat,’ said Hill, with the note of hysterics in his voice, ‘should 1 come here and tell you?’ 

‘Your repentance, of course, does you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt credit,’ said Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Bindon, ‘but it does not alter the original facts,* 

‘No, sir,’ said Hill, giving in in utter self-abasement. 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 221 
‘Even now you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt cause an enormous amount of trouble. 
The examination list will have to be revised.’ 

‘ I suppose so, sir.’ 

‘Suppose so? Of course it must be revised. And I don’t see how I can conscientiously pass you.’ 

‘Not pass me?’ said Hill. ‘Fail me?’ 

‘ It’s the rule in all examinations. or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt where should we be? What else did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt expect? you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t want to shirk the consequences of your own acts?* 

‘ I thought, perhaps ’ said Hill. And then, ‘ Fail me? 

I thought, as I told you, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt would simply deduct the marks given for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that slip.’ 

‘Impossible!’ said Bindon. ‘Besides, it would still leave 

you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt above Wedderburn. Deduct only the marks 

Preposterous! The Departmental Regulations distinctly say ’ 

‘But it’s my own admission, sir.’ 

‘The Regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter comes to light. They simply provide ’ 

‘It will ruin me. If I fail this examination, they won’t renew my scholarship.’ 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt should have thought of that before.’ 

‘But, sir, consider all my circumstances ’ 

‘ I cannot consider anything. Professors in this College are machines. The Regulations will not even let us recom- 
mend our students for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt appointments. I am a machine, 
and you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have worked me. I have to do ’ 

‘It’s very hard, sir.’ 

‘Possibly it is.’ 

‘If I am to be failed this examination, I might as well go home at once.’ 

‘That is as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think proper.’ Bindon’s voice softened a little; he perceived he had been unjust, and, provided he did not contradict himself, he was disposed to ameliora- 
tion. ‘As a private person,’ he said, ‘ I think this confession 
222 A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 

of yours goes far to mitigate your offence. But you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt have set the machinery in motion, and now it must take its course. I — 1 am really sorry you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt gave way.’ 

A wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering. 
Suddenly, very vividly, he saw the heavily-lined face of the old Landpoit cobbler, his father. ‘Good God! What a foci I have been!’ he said hotly and abruptly. 

‘ 1 hope,’ said Bindon, ‘that it will be a lesson to you.’ 

But, curiously enough, they were not thinking of quite the same indiscretion. 

There was a pause. 

‘ I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will let you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know — about going home, I mean,’ said Hill, moving towards the door. 

The next day Hill’s place was vacant. The spectacled girl in green was, as usual, first with the news. Wedder- 
burn and Miss Haysman were talking of a performance of The Meistersingers when she came up to them. 

‘Have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt heard?’ she said. 

'Heard what?’ 

‘There was cheating in the examination.’ 

‘Cheating!’ said Wedderburn, with his face suddenly hot. ‘How?’ 

‘That slide ’ 

‘Moved? Never!’ 

‘It was. That slide that we weren’t to move’ 

‘Nonsense!’ said Wedderburn. ‘W'hy! How could ihey find out? Who do they say ?’ 

‘It was Mr. Hill.” 

‘ /////.?’ 

‘Mr. Hill!’ 

‘Not-— surely not the immaculate Hill?’ said Wedderburn, 
recovering. 

‘I don’t believe it,’ said Miss Haysman. ‘How do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know?’ 
A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 223 

‘I didn’t,^ said the girl in spectacles. ‘But I know it now for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a fact. Mr. Hill went and confessed to Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Bindon himself.’ 

‘By Jove!’ said Wedderburn. ‘Hill of all people. But 1 am always inclined to distrust these philanthropists -on principle ’ 

‘Are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt quite sure?’ said Miss Haysman, with a catch in her breath. 

‘Quite. It’s dreadful, isn’t it? But, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, what can you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt expect? His father is a cobbler.’ 

Then Miss Haysman astonished the girl in spectacles. 

‘I don’t care. I will not believe it,’ she said, flushing darkly under her warm-tinted skin. ‘I will not believe it until he has told me so himself— face to face. I would scarcely believe it then,’ and abruptly she turned her back on the girl in spectacles, and walked to her own place. 

‘It’s true, all the same,’ said the girl in spectacles, peering and smiling at Wedderburn. 

But Wedderburn did not answer her. She was indeed one of those people who seem destined to make unanswered remarks.

In truth the mastery of flying was the work of thousands of men — this man a suggestion and that an experiment, 
until at last only one vigorous intellectual eflFort was needed to finish the work. But the inexorable injustice of the popular mind has decided that of all these thousands, one man, and that a man who never flew, should be chosen as the discoverer, just as it has chosen to honour Watt as the discoverer of steam and Stephenson of the steam- 
engine. ' And surely of all honoured names none is so grotesquely and tragically honoured as poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Filmer’s, the timid, intellectual creature who solved the problem over which the world had hung perplexed and a little fearful for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so many generations, the man who pressed the button that has changed peace and warfare and wellnigh every condition of human life and happiness. Never has that recurring wonder of the littleness of the scientific man in the face of the greatness of his science found such an amazing exemplification. Much concerning Filmer is, and must remain, profoundly obscure — Filmers attract no Boswells — but the essential facts an^ the concluding scene are clear enough, and there are letters, and notes, and casual allusions to piece the whole together. And this is the story one makes, putting this thing with that, of Filmer's life and death. 

The first authentic trace of Filmer on the page of history is a document in which he applies for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt admission as a paid student in physics to the Government laboratories at South Kensington, and therein he describes himself as the son of a ‘military bootmaker’ (‘cobbler’ in the vulgar tongue) 
of Dover, and lists his various examination proofs of a high proficiency in chemistry and mathematics. With a certain want of dignity he seeks to enhance these attainments 
FILMER 
225 
by a profession of poverty and disadvantages, and he writes of the laboratory as the ‘gaol’ of his ambitions, a slip which reinforces his claim to have devoted himself exclusively to the exact sciences. The document is endorsed in a manner that shows Filmer was admitted to this coveted opportunity; but until quite recently no traces of his success in the Government institution could be found. 

It has now, however, been shown that in spite of his professed zeal for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt research, Filmer, before he had held this scholarship a year, was tempted by the possibility of a small increase in his immediate income, to abandon it in order to become one of the nine-pence-an-hour com- 
puters employed by a well-known Professor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt in his vicarious conduct of those extensive researches of his in solar physics 
— researches which are still a matter of perplexity to astronomers. Afterwards, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the space of fjeven years, 
save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the pass lists of the London University, in which he is seen to climb slov/ly to a double first-class B.Sc., in mathematics and chemistry, there is no evidence of how' 
Filmer passed his life. No one knows how or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt where he lived, though it seems highly probable that he continued to support himself by teaching while he prosecuted the studies necessary for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this distinction. And then, oddly enough, one finds him mentioned in the correspondence of Arthur Hicks, the poet. 

‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt remember Filmer,* Hicks writes to his friend Vance; ‘well he hasn’t altered a bit, the same hostile mumble and the nasty chin — ^how can a man contrive to be always three days from shaving? — and a sort of furtive air of being engaged in sneaking in front of one; even his coat and that frayed coUar of his show no further signs of the passing of years. He was writing in the library and I sat down beside him in the name of God’s charity, 
whereupon he deliberately insulted me by covering up his memoranda. It seems he has some brilliant research on hand that he suspects me of all people — with a Bodlcy 
226 
FILMER 
Booklet a-printing !— of stealing. He has taken remarkable honours at the University— he went through them with a sort of hasty slobber, as though he feared I might interrupt him before he had told me all — and he spoke of taking his D.Sc. as one might speak of taking a cab. And be asked what I was doing — with a sort of comparative accent, 
and his arm was spread nervously, positively a protecting arm, over the paper that hid the precious idea — his one hopeful idea. 

‘“Poetry,” he said “poetry. And what do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt profess to teach in it, Hicks?” 

‘The thing’s a provincial professorling in the very act of budding, and I thank the Lord devoutly that but for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the precious gift of indolence J also might have gone this way to D.Sc. and destruction . . .’ 

A curious little vignette that I am inclined to think caught Filmer in or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt near the very birth of his discovery. 

Hicks was wrong in anticipating a provincial professor- 
ship for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Filmer. Our next glimpse of him is lecturing on 
‘rubber and rubber substitutes’ to the Society of Arts — ^he had become manager to a great plastic-substance manu- 
factory — and at that time, it is now known, he was a member of the Aeronautical Society, albeit he contributed nothing to the discussions of that body, preferring no doubt to mature his great conception without external assistance. 

And within two years of that paper before the Society of Arts he was hastily taking out a number of patents and proclaiming in various undignified ways the completion of the divergent inquiries which made his flying machine possible. The first definite statement to that effect appeared in a half-penny evening paper through the agency of a man who lodged in the same house with Filmer. His final haste after his long laborious secret patience seems to have been due to a needless panic, Bootle, the notorious American scientific quack, having made an announcement 
FILMER 227 

that Filmer interpreted wrongly as an anticipation of his idea. 

Now what precisely was Filmer’s idea? Really a very simple one. Before his time the pursuit of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines, and had developed on the one hand balloons — large apparatus lighter than air, easy in ascent, and comparatively safe in descent, but floating helplessly before any breeze that took them; and on the other, flying machines that flew only in theory — vast flat structures heavier than air, propelled and kept up by heavy engines and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part smashing at the first descent. But, neglecting the fact that the inevitable final collapse rendered them impossible, the weight of the flying machines gave them this theoretical advantage, that they could go through the air against a wind, a necessary condi* 
tion if aerial navigation was to have any practical value. 
It is Filmer’s particular merit that he perceived the way in which the contrasted and hitherto incompatible merits of balloon and heavy flying machine might be combined in one apparatus, which should be at choice either heavier or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt lighter than air. He took hints from the contractile bladders of fish and the pneumatic cavities of birds. He devised an arrangement of contractile and absolutely closed balloons which when expanded could lift the actual flying apparatus with ease, and when retracted by the complicated 
‘musculature’ he wove about them, were withdrawn almost completely into the frame; and he built the large frame- 
work which these balloons sustained, of hollow, rigid tubes, 
the air in which, by an ingenious contrivance, was auto- 
matically pumped out as the apparatus fell, and which then remained exhausted so long as the aeronaut desired. 
There were no wings or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt propellers to his machine, such as there had been to all previous aeroplanes, and the only engine required was the compact and powerful little appliance needed to contract the balloons. He perceived that such an apparatus as he had devised might rise with 
228 
FILMER 
frame exhausted and balloons expanded to a considerable height, might then contract its balloons and let the air into its frame, and by an adjustment of its weights slide down the air in any desired direction. As it fell it would accumulate velocity and at the same time lose weight, and the momentum accumulated by its down-rush could be utilized by means of a shifting of its weights to drive it up in the air again as the balloons expanded. This concep- 
tion, which is still the structural conception of all successful flying machines, needed, however, a vast amount of toil upon its details before it could actually be realized, and such toil Filmer — as he was accustomed to tell the numerous interviewers who crowded upon him in the heyday of his fame — ‘ungrudgingly and unsparingly gave.’ His par- 
ticular difficulty was the elastic lining of the contractile balloon. He found he needed a new substance, and in the discovery and manufacture of that new substance he had, as he never failed to impress upon the interviewers, 
‘performed a far more arduous work than even in the actual achievement of my seemingly greater discovery.’ 

But it must not be imagined that these interviews followed hard upon Filmer’s proclamation of his invention. An interval of nearly five years elapsed during which he timidly remained at his rubber factory — he seems to have been entirely dependent on his small income from this source 
— making misdirected attempts to assure a quite indifferent public that he really had invented what he had invented. 
He occupied the greater part of his leisure in the com- 
position of letters to the scientific and daily press, and so forth, stating precisely the net result of his contrivances, 
and demanding financial aid. That alone would have sufficed for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the suppression of his letters. He spent such holidays as he could arrange in unsatisfactory interviews with the door-keepers of leading London papers — he was singularly not adapted for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt inspiring hall-porters with confi- 
dence — and he positively attempted to induce the War 
FILMER 
229 
Office to take up his work with him. There remains a confidential letter from Major-General Volleyfire to the Earl of Frogs. ‘The man’s a crank and a bounder to boot,’ says the Major-General in his bluff, sensible army way, and so left it open for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the Japanese to secure, as they subsequently did, the priority in this side of war- 
fare — a priority they still to our great discomfort retain. 

And then by a stroke of luck the membrane Filmer had invented for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his contractile balloon was discovered to be useful for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the valves of a new oil-engine, and he obtained the means for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt making a trial model of his inven- 
tion. He threw up his rubber factory appointment, 
desisted from all further writing, and, with a certain secrecy that seems to have been an inseparable characteristic of all his proceedings, set to work upon the apparatus. 
He seems to have directed the making of its parts and collected most of it in a room in Shoreditch, but its final putting together was done at Dymchurch, in Kent. He did not make the affair large enough to carry a man, but he made an extremely ingenious use of what were then called the Marconi rays to control its flight. The first flight of this first practicable flying machine took place over some fields near Burford Bridge, near Hythe, in Kent, and Filmer followed and controlled its flight upon a specially constructed motor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt tricycle. 

The flight was, considering all things, an amazing success. 
The apparatus was brought in a cart from Dymchurch to Burford Bridge, ascended there to a height of nearly three hundred feet, swooped thence very nearly back to Dym- 
church, came about in its sweep, rose again, circled, and finally sank uninjured in a field behind the Burford Bridge Inn. At its descent a curious thing happened. Filmer got off his tricycle, scrambled over the intervening dyke, 
advanced perhaps twenty yards towards his triumph, threw out his arms in a strange gesticulation, and fell dowiii in a dead faint. Everyone could then recall the ghastliness 
230 
FILMER 
of his features and all the evidences of extreme excitement they had observed throughout the trial, things they might otherwise have forgotten. Afterwards in the inn he had an unaccountable gust of hysterical weeping. 

Altogether there were not twenty witnesses of this affair, 
and those for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part uneducated men. The New Romney doctor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw the ascent but not the descent, his horse being frightened by the electrical apparatus on Filmer’s tricycle and giving him a nasty spill. Two members of the Kent constabulary watched the affair from a cart in an unofficial spirit, and a grocer calling round the Marsh for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt orders and two lady cycUsts seem almost to complete the list of educated people. There were two reporters present, one representing a Folkestone paper and the other being a fourth -class interviewer and ‘sym- 
posium’ journalist, whose expenses down, Filmer, anxious as ever for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt adequate advertisement — and now quite realizing the way in which adequate advertisement may be obtained 
—had paid. The latter was one of those writers who can throw a convincing air of unreality over the most credible events, and his half-facetious account of the aflFair appeared in the magazine page of a popular journal. But, 
happily for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Filmer, this person’s colloquial methods were more convincing. He went to offer some further screed upon the subject to Banghurst, the proprietor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the New Paper, and one of the ablest and most unscrupulous men in London journalism, and Banghurst instantly seized upon the situation. The interviewer vanishes from the narrative, 
no doubt very doubtfully remunerated, and Banghurst, 
Banghurst himself, double chin, grey twill suit, abdomen, 
voice, gestures and all, appears at Djmichurch, following his large, unrivalled journalistic nose. He had seen the whole thing at a glance, just what it was and what it might be. 

At his touch, as it were, Filmer’s long-pent investigations exploded into fame. He instantly and most magnificently 
FILMER 
231 
was a Boom. One turns over the files of the journals of the year 1907 with a quite incredulous recognition of how swift and flaming the boom of those days could be. The July papers know nothing of flying, see nothing in flying, 
state by a most effective silence that men never would, 
could, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt should fly. In August flying and Filmer and flying and parachutes and aerial tactics and the Japanese Government and Filmer and again flying, shouldered the war in Yunnan and the gold mines of Upper Greenland oflf the leading page. And Banghurst had given ten thousand pounds, and, further, Banghurst was giving five thousand pounds, and Banghurst had devoted his well- 
known, magnificent (but hitherto sterile) private labora- 
tories and several acres of land near his private residence on the Surrey hills to the strenuous and violent completion 
— Banghurst fashion — of the life-size practicable flying machine. Meanwhile, in the sight of privileged multitudes in the walled -garden of the Banghurst town residence in Fulham, Filmer was exhibited at weekly garden parties putting the working model through its paces. At enormous initial cost, but with a final profit, the New Paper presented its readers with a beautiful photographic souvenir of the first of these occasions. 

Here again the correspondence of Arthur Hicks and his friend Vance comes to our aid. 

‘1 saw Filmer in his glory,’ he writes, with just the touch of envy natural to his position as a poet passe, ‘The man is brushed and shaved, dressed in the fashion of a Royal - 
Institution-Afternoon Lecturer, the very newest shape in frock-coats and long patent shoes, and altogether in a state of extraordinary streakiness between an owlish great man and a scared abashed self-conscious bounder cruelly exposed. He hasn’t a touch of colour in the skin of his face, his head jets forward, and those queer little dark amber eyes of his watch furtively round him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his fame. 
His clothes fit perfectly and yet sit upon him as though 
232 
FILMER 
he had bought them ready-made. He speaks in a mumble still, but he says, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt perceive indistinctly, enormous self- 
assertive things, he backs into the rear of groups by instinct if Banghurst drops the line for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a minute, and when he walks across Banghurst’s lawn one perceives him a little out of breath and going jerky, and that his weak white hands are clenched. His is a state of tension — horrible tension. And he is the Greatest Discoverer of This or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Any Age — the Greatest Discoverer of This or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Any Age I What strikes one so forcibly about him is that he didn’t somehow quite expect it ever, at any rate, not at all like this. Banghurst is about everywhere, the energetic M.C. 
of his great little catch, and I swear he will have everyone down on his lawn there before he has finished with the engine; he had bagged the prime minister yesterday, and he, bless his heart! didn’t look particularly outsize, on the very first occasion. Conceive it! Filmerl Our obscure unwashed Filmer, the Glory of British science! 
Duchesses crowd upon him, beautiful, bold peeresses say in their beautiful, clear loud voices — have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt noticed how penetrating the great lady is becoming nowadays? — ‘Oh, 
Mr. Filmer, how did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt do it?’ 

‘Common men on the edge of things arc too remote for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the answer. One imagines something in the way of that interview, “toil. ungrudgingly and unsparingly given. 
Madam, and, perhaps — 1 don’t know — but perhaps a little special aptitude.’” 

So far Hicks, and the photographic supplement to the New Paper is in sufficient harmony with the description. 
In one picture the machine swings down towards the river, 
and the tower of Fulham church appears below it through a gap in the elms, and in another, Filmer sits at his guiding batteries, and the great and beautiful of the earth stand around him, with Banghurst massed modestly but resolutely in the rear. The grouping is oddly apposite. Occluding much of Banghurst, and looking with a pensive, speculative 
FILMER 
233 
expression at Filmer, stands the Lady Mary Elkinghorn, 
still beautiful, in spite of the breath of scandal and her cight-and-thirty years, the only person whose face does not admit a perception of the camera that was in the act of snapping then\ all. 

So much for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the exterior https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt facts of the story, but, after all, they are very exterior https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt facts. About the real interest of the business one is necessarily very much in the dark. 
How was Filmer feeling at the time? How much was a certain unpleasant anticipation present inside that very new and fashionable frock-coat? He w^as in the half- 
penny, penny, sixpenny, and more expensive papers alike, 
and acknowledged by the whole world as ‘the Greatest Discoverer of This or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Any Age.’ He had invented a prac- 
ticable hying machine, and every day down among the Surrey hills the life-sized model was getting ready. And when it was ready, it followed as a clear inevitable con- 
sequence of his having invented and made it — everybody in the world, indeed, seemed to take it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt granted; there wasn’t a gap anywhere in that serried front of anticipation 
— that he would proudly and cheerfully get aboard it, 
ascend with it, and fly. 

But we know now pretty clearly that simple pride and cheerfulness in such an act were singularly out of harmony with Filmer’s private constitution. It occurred to no one at the time, but there the fact is. We can guess with some confidence now that it must have been drifting about in his mind a great deal during the day, and, from a little note to his physician complaining of persistent insomnia^ 
we have the soundest reason for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt supposing it dominated his nights — the idea that it would be after all, in spite of his theoretical security, an abominably sickening, uncom- 
fortable, and dangerous thing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him to flap about in nothingness a thousand feet or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so in the air. It must have dawned upon him quite early in the period of being the Greatest Discoverer of This or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Any Age, the vision of 
234 
FILMER 
doing this and that with an extensive void below. Perhaps somewhen in his youth he had looked down a great height or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fallen down in some excessively uncomfortable way; 
perhaps some habit of sleeping on the wrong side had resulted in that disagreeable falling nightmare one knows, 
and given him his horror; of the strength of that horror https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt there remains now not a particle of doubt. 

Apparently he had never w'eighed this duty of flying in his earlier days of research; the machine had been his end, but now things were opening out beyond his end, 
and particularly this giddy whirl up above there. He was a Discoverer and he had Discovered. But he was not a Flying Man, and it was only now that he was beginning to perceive clearly that he was expected to fly. Yet, how- 
ever much the thing was present in his mind he gave no expression to it until the very end, and meanwhile he went to and fro from Banghursf s magnificent laboratories, 
and was interviewed and lionized, and wore good clothes, 
and ate good food, and lived in an elegant flat, enjoying a very abundant feast of such good, coarse, wholesome Fame and Success as a man, starved for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all his years as he had been starved, might be reasonably expected to enjoy. 

After a time, the weekly gatherings in Fulham ceased. 
The model had failed one day just for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment to respond to Filmer's guidance, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he had been distracted by the compliments of an archbishop. At any rate, it suddenly dug its nose into the air just a little too steeply as the arch- 
bishop was saihng through a Latin quotation for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all the world like an archbishop in a book, and it came down in the Fulham Road within three yards of a ’bus horse. 
It stood for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a second perhaps, astonishing and in its attitude astonished, then it crumpled, shivered into pieces, and the 
’bus horse was incidentally killed. 

Filmer lost the end of the archiepiscopal compliment. 
He stood up and stared as his invention swooped out of 
FILMER 
235 
sight and reach of him. His long, white hands still gripped his useless apparatus. The archbishop followed his sky- 
ward stare with an apprehension unbecoming in an arch- 
bishop. 

Then came the crash and the shouts and uproar from the road to relieve Filmer’s tension. ‘My God!' he whispered, and sat down. 

Everyone else almost was staring to see where the machine had vanished, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt rushing into the house. 

The making of the big machine progressed all the more rapidly for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt this. Over its making presided Filmer, always a little slow and very careful in his manner, always with a growing preoccupation in his mind. His care over the strength and soundness of the apparatus was prodigious. 
The slightest doubt, and he delayed everything until the doubtful part could be replaced. Wilkinson, his senior https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt assistant, fumed at some of these delays, which, he insisted, 
were for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part unnecessary. Banghurst magnified the patient certitude of Filmer in the New Paper, and reviled it bitterly to his wife, and MacAndiw, the second assistant, approved Filmer’s wisdom. ‘We’re not wanting a fiasco, man,’ said MacAndrew. ‘He’s perfectly well advised.’ 

And whenever an opportunity arose Filmer would expound to Wilkinson and MacAndrew just exactly how every part of the flying machine was to be controlled and worked, so that in eCTect they would be just as capable, 
and even more capable, when at last the time came, of guiding it through the skies. 

Now I should imagine that if Filmer had seen fit at this stage to define just what he was feeling, and to take a definite line in the matter of his ascent, he might have escaped that painful ordeal quite easily. If he had had it clearly in his mind he could have done endless things. 
He would surely have found no difficulty with a specialist to demonstrate a weak heart, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt something gastric or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt

FILMER 
pulmonary, lo stand in his way — that is the line 1 am astonished he did not take — or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he might, had he been man enough, have declared simply and finally that he did not intend to do the thing. But the fact is, though the dread was hugely present in his mind, the thing was by no means sharp and clear. I fancy that all through this period he kept telling himself that when the occasion came he would find himself equal to it. He was like a man just gripped by a great illness, who says he feels a little out of sorts, and expects to be better presently. Meanwhile he delayed the completion of the machine, and let the assumption that he was going to fly it take root and flourish exceedingly about him. He even accepted anticipatory compliments on his courage. And, barring this secret squearaishness, there can be no doubt he found all the praise and distinction and fuss he got a delightful and even intoxicating draught. 

The Lady Mary Elkinghorn made things a little more complicated for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him. 

How that began was a subject of inexhaustible speculation to Hicks. Probably in the beginning she was just a little 
’nice’ to him with that impartial partiality of hers, and it may be that to her eyes, standing out conspicuously as he did ruling his monster in the upper air, he had a distinction that Hicks was not disposed to find. And somehow they must have had a moment of sufficient isolation, and the great Discoverer a moment of sufficient courage for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt something just a little personal to be mumbled or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt blurted. However it began, there is no doubt that it did begin, and presently became quite perceptible to a world accustomed to find in the proceedings of the Lady Mary Elkinghorn a matter of entertainment. 
It complicated things, because the state of love in such a virgin mind as Filmer’s would brace his resolution, 
if not sufficiently, at any rate considerably, towards facing a danger he feared, and hampered him in such 
FILMER 237 

attempts at evasion as would otherwise be natural and congenial. 

It remains a matter for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt speculation just how the Lady Mary felt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Filmer and just what she thought of him. 
At thirty-eight one may have gathered much wisdom and still be not altogether wise, and the imagination still func- 
tions actively enough in creating glamours and effecting the impossible. He came before her eyes as a very central man, and that always counts, and he had powers, unique powers as it seemed, at any rate in the air. The per- 
formance with the model had just a touch of the qu^ty of a potent incantation, and women have ever displayed an unreasonable disposition to imagine that when a man has powers he must necessarily have Power. Given so much, and what was not good in Filmer’s manner and appearance became an added merit. He was modest, he hated display, but given an occasion where true qualities are needed, then — then one would seel 

The late Mrs. Bampton thought it wise to convey to Lady Mary her opinion that Filmer, all things considered, 
was rather a ‘grub.’ ‘He’s certainly not a sort of man I have ever met before,’ said the Lady Mary, with a quite unruffled serenity. And Mrs. Bampton, after a swift, 
imperceptible glance at that serenity, decided that so far as saying anything to Lady Mary went, she had done as much as could be expected of her. But she said a great deal to other people. 

And at last, without any undue haste or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt unseemliness, 
the day dawned, the great day, when Banghurst had promised his public — the world in fact — that flying should be finally attained and overcome. Filmer saw it dawn, 
watched even in the darkness before it dawned, watched its stars fade and the grey and pearly pinks give place at last to the clear blue sky of a sunny, cloudless day. Ho watched it from the window of his bedroom in the new- 
built wing of Banghurst’s Tudor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt house. And as the stari 
238 
FILMER 
were overwhelmed and the shapes and substances of things grew into being out of the amorphous dark, he must have seen more and more distinctly the festive preparations beyond the beech clumps near the green pavilion in the outer park, the three stands for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the privileged spectators, 
the raw, new fencing of the enclosure, the sheds and work- 
shops, the Venetian masts and fluttering flags that Bang- 
hurst had considered essential, black and limp in the breeze - 
less dawn, and amidst all these things a great shape covered with tarpaulin. A strange and terrible portent for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt humanity was that shape, a beginning that must surely spread and widen and change and dominate all the affairs of men, but to Filmer it is very doubtful whether it appeared in anything but a narrow and personal light. Several people heard him pacing in the small hours — ^for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the vast place was packed with guests by a proprietor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt editor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt who, 
before all things, understood compression. And about five o’clock, if not before, Filmer left his room and wandered out of the sleeping house into the park, alive by that time with sunlight and birds and squirrels and the fallow deer. 
MacAndrew, who was also an early riser, met him near the machine, and they went and had a look at it together. 

It is doubtful if Filmer took any breakfast, in spite of the urgency of Banghurst. So soon as the guests began to be about in some number he seems to have retreated to his room. Thence about ten he went into the shrubbery, 
very probably because he had seen the Lady Mary Hiking- 
horn there. She was walking up and down, engaged in conversation with her old school friend, Mrs. Brewis- 
Craven, and although Filmer had never met the latter lady before, he joined them and walked beside them for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some time. There were several silences in spite of the Lady Mary's brilliance. The situation was a difiicult one, 
and Mrs. Brewis -Craven did not master its difficulty. 
‘He struck me,’ she said afterwards with a luminous self-contradiction, ‘as a very unhappy person who had 
FILMER 
239 
something to say, and wanted before all things to be helped to say it. But how was one to help him when one didn’t know what it was?’ 

At half-past eleven the enclosures for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the public in the outer park were crammed, there was an intermittent stream of equipages along the belt which circles the outer park, 
and the house party was dotted over the lawn and shrubbery and the corner of the inner park, in a series of brilliantly attired knots, all making for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the flying machine. Filmer walked in a group of three with Banghurst, who was supremely and conspicuously happy, and Sir Theodore Hickle, the president of the Aeronautical Society. Mrs. 
Banghurst was close behind with the Lady Mary Hiking- 
horn, Georgina Hickle, and the Dean of Stays. Banghurst was large and copious in speech, and such interstices as he left were filled in by Hickle with complimentary remarks to Filmer. And Filmer walked between them saying not a word except by way of unavoidable reply. Behind, Mrs. 
Banghurst listened to the admirably suitable and shapely conversation of the Dean with that fluttered attention to the ampler clergy ten years of social ascent and ascendency had not cured in her; and the Lady Mary watched, no doubt with an entire confidence in the world’s disillusion • 
ment, the drooping shoulders of the sort of man she had never met before. 

There was some cheering as the central party came into view of the enclosures, but it was not very unanimous nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt invigorating cheering. They were within fifty yards ol the apparatus when Filmer took a hasty glance over his shoulder to measure the distance of the ladies behind them, 
and decided to make the first remark he had initiatec since the house had been left. His voice was just a little hoarse, and he cut in on Banghurst in mid-sentence or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Progress. 

‘I say, Banghurst,’ he said, and slopped. 

‘Yes,' said Banghurst. 
240 
FILMER 
‘I wish ’ He moistened his lips. ‘Fm not feeling 

well.’ 

Banghurst stopped dead. ‘Eh?’ he shouted. 

‘A queer feeling.’ Filmer made to move on, but Bang- 
hurst was immovable. ‘I don’t know. I may be better in a minute. If not — perhaps . . . MacAndrew ’ 

‘You’re not feeling welW said Banghurst, and stared at his white face, 

‘My dear!’ he said, as Mrs. Banghurst came up with them, ‘Filmer says he isn’t feeling well'' 

‘A little queer,’ exclaimed Filmer, avoiding the Lady Mary’s eyes. * It may pass off ’ 

There was a pause. 

It came to Filmer that he was the most isolated person in the world. 

‘In any case,’ said Banghurst, ‘the ascent must be made. 
Perhaps if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt were to sit down somewhere for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment ’ 

‘ It’s the crowd, 1 think,’ said Filmer. 

There was a second pause. Banghurst’s eye rested in flcrutiny on Filmer, and then swept the sample of public In the enclosure. 

‘It’s unfortunate,’ said Sir Theodore Hickle; ‘but still — 

I suppose Your assistants Of course, if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 

feel out of condition and disinclined ’ 

‘I don’t think Mr. Filmer would permit that for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment,’ said the Lady Mary. 

‘But if Mr. Filmer’s nerve is run It might even 

be dangerous for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him to attempt ’ Hickle coughed. 

‘It’s just because it’s dangerous,’ began the Lady Mary, 
and felt she had made her point of view and Filmer’s plain enough. 

Conflicting motives struggled for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Filmer. 

‘I feel I ought to go up,’ he said, regarding the ground. 
He looked up and met the Lady Mary’s eyes. ‘I want to go up,’ he said, and smiled wWtely at her. He turned 
FILMER 241 

towards Banghurst. 'If I could just sit down some- 
where for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a moment out of the crowd and sun ’ 

Banghurst, at least, was beginning to understand the case. ‘Come into my little room in the green pavilion,’ 
he said. ‘It’s quite cool there/ He took Filmer by the arm. 

Filmer turned his face to the Lady Mary Elkinghorn again. ‘I shall be all right in five minutes,’ he said. ‘I’m tremendously sorry ’ 

The Lady Mary Elkinghorn smiled at him. ‘I couldn’t think,’ he said to Hickle, and obeyed the compulsion of Banghurst’s pull. 

The rest remained watching the two recede. 

‘He is so fragile,’ said the Lady Mary. 

‘He’s certainly a highly nervous type,’ said the Dean, 
who^e weakness it was to regard the whole world, except married clergymen with enormous families, as ‘neurotic.’ 

‘Of course,’ said Hickle, ‘it isn’t absolutely necessary for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him to go up because he has invented ’ 

'How could he avoid it?’ asked the Lady Mary, with the faintest shadow of scorn. 

‘It’s certainly most unfortunate if he’s going to be ill now,’ said Mrs. Banghurst a little severely, 

‘He’s not going to be ill,’ said the Lady Mary, and certainly she had met Filraer’s eye. 

‘ You'll be all right,’ said Banghurst, as they went towards the pavilion. ‘All you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt want is a nip of brandy. It ought to ^ you, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know. You’ll be— you’d get it rough, 
you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know, if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt let another man ’ 

‘Oh, I want to go,’ said Filmer, ‘I shall be all right 

As a matter of fact I’m almost inclined now No! 

I think I’ll have that nip of brandy first.’ 

Banghurst took him into the little room and routed out an empty decanter. He departed in search of a supply. 
He was gone perhaps five minutes. 

The history of those five minutes cannot be written. 
242 
FILMER 
At intervals Filmer’s face could be seen by the people on the easternmost of the stands erected for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt spectators, against the window pane peering out, and then it would recede and fade. Banghurst vanished shouting behind the grand stand, and presently the butler appeared going pavilion- 
ward with a tray. 

The apartment in which Filmer came to his last solution was a pleasant b'ttle room very simply furnished with green furniture and an old bureau — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Banghurst was simple in all his private ways. It was hung with little engravings after Morland and it had a shelf of books. But as it happened, Banghurst had left a rook rifle he sometimes played with on the top of the desk, and on the corner of the mantelshelf was a tin with three or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt four cartridges remaining in it. As Filmer went up and down that room wrestling with his intolerable dilemma he went fir st towards the neat little rifle athwart the blotting-pad and then towards the neat little red label 

‘.22 LONG.’ 

The thing must have jumped into his mind in a moment. 

Nobody seems to have connected the report with him, 
though the gun, being fired in a confined space, must have sounded loud, and there were several people in the billiard- 
room, separated from him only by a lath-and -plaster partition. But directly Banghurst’s butler opened the door https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and smell the sour smell of the smoke, he knew, he says, 
what had happened. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the servants at least of Bang- 
hurst’s household had guessed something of what was going on in Filmer’s mind. 

All through that trying afternoon Banghurst behaved as he held a man should behave in the presence of hopeless disaster, and bis guests for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part succeeded in not insisting upon the fact — ^though to conceal their perception of it altogether was impossible— that Banghurst had been 
FILMER 
243 
pretty elaborately and completely swindled by the deceased. 
The public in the enclosure, Hicks told me, dispersed Mike a party that has been ducking a welsher,’ and there wasn’t a soul in the train to London, it seems, who hadn’t known all along that flying was a quite impossible thing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt man. 
‘But he might have tried it,’ said many, ‘after carrying the thing so far.’ 

In the evening, when he was comparatively alone, 
Banghurst broke down and went on like a man of clay. 
1 have been told he wept, which must have made an imposing scene, and he certainly said Filmer had ruined his life, and offered and sold the whole apparatus to Mac- 

Andrew for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt half-a -crown. ‘I’ve been thinking ’ said 

MacAndrew at the conclusion of the bargain, and stopped. 

The next morning the name of Filmer was, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the first time, less conspicuous in the New Paper than in any other daily paper in the world. The rest of the world’s instructors, with varying emphasis, according to their dignity and the degree of competition between themselves and the New Paper, proclaimed the ‘Entire Failure of Ihe New Flying Machine,’ and ‘Suicide of the Impostor.* 
But in the district of North Surrey the reception of the news was tempered by a perception of unusual aerial phenomena. 

Overnight Wilkinson and MacAndrew had fallen into violent argument on the exact motives of their principal’s rash act. 

‘The man was certainly a poor, cowardly body, but so far as his science went he was no impostor,’ said Mac- 
Andrew, ‘and I’m prepared to give that proposition a very practical demonstration, Mr. Wilkinson, so soon as we’ve got the place a little more to ourselves. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I’ve no faith in all this publicity for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt experimental trials.’ 

And to that end, while all the world was reading of the certain failure of ihe new flying machine, MacAndrew was soaring and curvetting with great amplitude and dignity 
244 
FILMER 
oyer the Epsom and Wimbledon divisions; and Banghurst, 
restored once more to hope and energy, and regardless of public security and the Board of Trade, was pursuing his gjTations and trying to attract his attention, on a motor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt car and in his pyjamas— he had caught sight of the ascent when pulling up the blind of his bedroom window— equipped, among other things, with a film camera that was subsequently discovered to be jammed. 

And Filmer was lying on the billiard table in the green pavilion with a sheet about his body. 
JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 
‘It isn’t everyone who’s been a god,’ said the sunburnt man. ‘But it’s happened to me. Among other things.’ 

I intimated my sense of his condescension. 

‘It don’t leave much for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ambition, does it?’ said the sunburnt man. 

‘ I was one of those men who was saved from the Ocean Pioneer. Gummy! how time flies! It’s twenty years ago. 
I doubt if you’ll remember anything of the Ocean Pioneer?' 

The name was familiar, and I tried to recall when and where I had read it. The Ocean Pioneer? ‘Something about gold dust,’ I said vaguely, ‘but the precise ’ 

‘That’s it,’ he said. ‘In a beastly little channel she hadn’t no business in — dodging pirates. It was before they’d put the kybosh on that business. And thcre’d been volcanoes or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt something and all the rocks was wrong. 
There’s places about by Soona where you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fair have to follow the rocks about to sec where they’re going next. 
Down she went in twenty fathoms before you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt could have dealt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt whist, with fifty thousand pounds worth of gold aboard, it was said, in one form or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt another.’ 

‘Survivors?’ 

‘Three.’ 

‘I remember the case now,’ I said. ‘There was some- 
thing about salvage ’ 

But at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so extraordinarily horrible that I stopped aghast. He came down to more ordinary swearing, and pulled himself up abruptly. ‘Excuse me,’ he said, ‘but — 
salvage!’ 

He leant over towards me. ‘I was in that job,’ he said. 
‘Tried to make myself a rich man, and got made a god instead. I’ve got my feelings 
246 JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

‘It ain’t all jam being a god,’ said the sunburnt man, 
and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some time conversed by means of such pithy but unprogressive axioms. At last he took up his tale again. 

‘There was me,’ said the sunburnt man, ‘and a seaman named Jacobs, and Always, the mate of the Ocean Pioneer. 
And him it was that set the whole thing going. I remember him now, when we was in the jolly boat, suggesting it all to our minds just by one sentence. He was a wonderful hand at suggesting things. “There was forty thousand pounds,” he said, “on that ship, and it’s for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt rre to say just where she went down.” It didn’t need much brains to tumble to that. And he was the leader from the first to the last. He got hold of the Sanderses and their brig; 
they were brothers, and the brig was the Pride of Banya, 
and he it was bought the diving-dress — a second-hand one with a compressed air apparatus instead of pumping. He’d have done the diving too, if it hadn’t made him sick going down. And the salvage people were mucking about with a chart he’d cooked up, as solemn as could be, at Starr Race, a hundred and twenty miles away. 

‘1 can tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt we was a happy lot aboard ihat brig, 
jokes and drink and bright hopes all the time. It all seemed so neat and clean and straightforward, and what rough chaps call a “cert,” And we used to speculate how the other blessed lot, the proper salvagers, who’d started two days before us, were getting on, until our sides fairly ached. We all messed together in the Sanderses’ cabin — 
it was a curious crew, all officers and no men — and there stood the diving-dress waiting its turn. Young Sanders was a humorous sort of chap, and there certainly was something funny in the confounded thing’s great fat head and its stare, and he made us see it too. “Jimmy Goggles,” 
he used to call it, and talk to it like a Christian. Asked if he was married, and how Mrs. Goggles was, and all the little Goggleses. Fit to make you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt split. And

right between two chunks of ropy grey rock — lava rocks that rose nearly out of the water. We had to lay otf about half a mile to get a safe anchorage, and there was a thundering row who should stop on board. And there she lay just as she had gone down, so that you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt could see the top of the masts that was still standing perfectly dis- 
tinctly. The row ended in all coming in the boat. I went down in the diving-dress on Friday morning directly it was light. 

‘What a surprise it was! I can see it ail now quite distinctly. It was a queer-looking place, and the light was just coming. People over here think every blessed place in the tropics is a flat shore and palm trees and surf, bless ’em! This place, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, wasn’t a bit that way. Not common rocks they were, undermined by waves; but great curved banks like ironwork cinder heaps, 
with green slime below, and thorny shrubs and things just waving upon them here and there, and the water glassy calm and clear, and showing you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a kind of dirty grey-black shine, with huge flaring red -brown weeds spreading motionless, and crawling and darting things going through it. And far away beyond the ditches and pools and the heaps was a forest on the mountain flank, 
growing again after the fires and cinder showers of the last eruption. And the other way forest, too, and a kind of broken— what is it? — araby-theatre of black and rusty

cinders rising out of it all, and the sea in a kind of bay in the middle. 

‘The dawn, I say, was just coming, and there wasn’t much colour about things, and not a human being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt down the channel. 
Except the Pride of Banya, lying out beyond a lump of rocks towards the line of the sea. 

‘Not a human being in sight,’ he repeated, and paused. 

* 1 don’t know where they came from, not a bit. 4nd we were feeling so safe that we were all alone that poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt young Sanders was a-singing. J was in Jimmy Goggles, 
all except the helmet. “Easy,” says Always, “there’s her mast.” And after I’d had just one squint over the gun- 
wale, 1 caught up the bogey and almost tipped out as old Sanders brought the boat round. V/hen the v/indows were screwed and everything was all right, I simt the valve from the air belt in order to help my sinking, and jumped over- 
board, feet foremost— for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt we hadn’t a ladder. I left the boat pitching, and all of them staring down into the water after me, as my head sank down into the weeds and black- 
ness that lay about the mast. I suppose nobody, not the most cautious chap in the world, would have bothered about a look-out at such a desolate place. It stunk of solitude. 

‘Of course you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt must understand that I was a green- 
horn at diving. None of us were divers. We’d had to muck about with the thing to get the way of it, and this was the first time I’d been deep. It feels damnable. Your ears hurt beastly. I don’t know if you’ve ever hurt your- 
self yawning or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt sneezing, but it takes you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like that, only ten times worse. And a pain over the eyebrows here — 
splitting— and a feeling Uke influenza in the head. And it isn’t all heaven in your lungs and things. And going down feels like the beginning of a lift, only it keeps on. 
And you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can’t turn your head to see what’s above you, 
and you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can’t get a fair squint at what’s happening to

JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

your feet without bending down something painful. And being deep it was dark, let alone the blackness of the ashes and mud that formed the bottom. It was like going down out of the dawn back into the night, so to speak. 

‘The mast came up like a ghost out of the black, and then a lot of fishes, and then a lot of flapping red seaweed, 
and then whack I came with a kind of dull bang on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer^ and the fishes that had been feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of flies from road stuff in summer-time. I turned on the com- 
pressed air again — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the suit was a bit thick and mackintoshery, after all, in spite of the rum— and stood recovering myself. It struck coolish down there, and that helped take off the stuffiness a bit. 

‘When I began to feel easier, 1 started looking about me. It was an extraordinary sight. Even the light was extraordinary, a kind of reddy coloured twilight, on account of the streamers of seaweed that floated up on either side of the ship. And far overhead just a moony, deep green blue. The deck of the ship, except for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a slight list to star- 
board, was level, and lay all dark and long between the weeds, clear except where the masts had snapped when she rolled, and vanishing into black night towards the fore- 
castle. There weren’t any dead on the decks, most were in the weeds alongside, I suppose; but afterwards I found two skeletons lying in the passengers’ cabins, where death had come to them. It was curious to stand on that deck and recognize it all, bit by bit; a place against the rail where I’d been fond of smoking by starlight, and the comer where an old chap from Sydney used to flirt with a widow we had aboard. A comfortable couple they’d been, only a month ago, and now you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt couldn’t have got a meal for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a baby crab off either of them. 

‘Fve always had a bit of a philosophical turn, and I dare say I spent the best part of five minutes in such thoughts 
250 JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

before I went below to find where the blessed dust was stored. It was slow work hunting, feeling it was for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part, pitchy dark, with confusing blue gleams down the companion. And there were things moving about, a dab at my glass once, and once a pinch at my leg. Crabs I expect, f kicked a lot of loose stuff that puzzled me, 
and stooped and picked up something all knobs and spikes. 
What do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think? Backbone! But J never had any particular feeling for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt bones. We had talked the affair over pretty thoroughly, and Always knew just where the stuff was stowed. 1 found it that trip. I lifted a box one end an inch or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more.’ 

He broke off in his story. ‘I’ve lifted it,’ he said, ‘as near as that! E'orty thousand pounds’ worth of pure gold! Gold! 1 shouted inside my helmet as a kind of cheer and hurt my ears. I was getting confounded stuffy and tired by this time — I must have been down twenty-five minutes or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more — and I thought this was good enough. 
I went up the companion again, and as my eyes came up flush with the de^k, a thundering great crab gave a kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling olf sideways. Quite a start it gare me, I stood up clear on deck and shut the valve behind the helmet to let the air accumulate to carry me up again — 1 noticed a kind of whacking from above, as though they were hitting the water with an oar, but I didn’t look up. I fancied they were signalling me to come up. 

‘And tlien something shot down by me — something heavy, and stood a -quiver in the planks. I looked, and there was a long knife I’d seen young Sanejers handling. 
Thinks 1, he’s dropped it, and 1 was still calling him this kind of fool and that — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it might have hurt me serious 
— when 1 began to live and dive up towards the daylight. 
Just above the level of the top spars of the Ocean Pioneer^ 
whack! I came against something sinking down, and a boot knocked in front of my helmet. Then something 
JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 251 

else, struggling frightful. It was a big weight atop of me, whatever it was, and moving and twisting about. I’d have thought it a big octopus, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some such thing, if it hadn’t been for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the boot. But octopuses don’t wear boots. It was all in a moment, of course. I felt myself sinking down again, and I threw my arms about to keep steady, and the whole lot rolled free of me and shot down as I went up ’ 

He paused. 

‘ I saw young Sanders’s face, over a naked black shoulder, 
and a spear driven clean through his neck, and out of his mouth and neck what looked like spirts of pink smoke in the water. And down they went clutching one another, 
and turning over, and both too far gone to leave go. 
And in another second my helmet came a whack, fit to split, against the niggers’ canoe. It was niggers! Two canoes full. 

‘ It was lively times, I tell you? Overboard came Always with three spears in him. There was the legs of three or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt four black chaps kicking about me in the water. I couldn’t see much, but I saw the game was up at a glance, gave my valve a tremendous twist, and went bubbling down again after poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Always, in as awful a state of scare and astonishment as you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can well imagine. I passed young Sanders and the nigger going up again and struggling still a bit, and in another moment I was standing in the dim again on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer. 

“'Gummy,” thinks I, “here’s a fix! Niggers?” At first I couldn’t see anything for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it but Stifle below or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Stabs above. I didn’t properly understand how much air there was to last me out, but I didn’t feel like standing very much more of it down below. I was hot and frightfully heady quite apart from the blue funk I was in. We’d never reckoned with these beastly natives, filthy Papuan beasts. It wasn’t any good coming up where I was, but i had to do something. On the spur of the moment 
25? JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

I clarabercd over the side of the brig and landed among the weeds, and set oflF through the darkness as fast as I could. 1 just stopped once and knelt, and twisted back my head in the helmet and had a look up. It was a most extraordinary bright green -blue above, and the two canoes and the boat floating there very small and distant like a kind of twisted 11. And it made me feel sick to squint up at it, acd think what the pitching and swaying of the three meant. 

*It was just about the most horrible ten minutes I ever had, blundering about in that darkness — pressure some- 
thing awfuh like being buried in sand, pain across the chest, sick with funk, and breathing nothing as it seemed hut the smell of rum and mackintosh! Gummy! After a bit, T found myself going up a steepish sort of slope. I haa another squint to see if anything was visible of the canoes and boats, and then kept on. 1 stopped with my head a foot from the surface, and tried to see where I was going, but, of course, nothing was to be seen but th© reflection of the bottom. Then out I dashed like knocking my head through a mirror. Directly 1 got my eyes out of the water, I saw I’d come up a kind of beach near I he forest. I had a look round, but the natives and the brig were both hidden by a big hummucky heap of twisted lava. The born fool in me suggested a run for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the woods. I didn’t take the helmet off, but I eased open one of the windows, and, after a bit of a pant, went on out of the water. You’d hardly imagine how clean and light the air tasted. 

‘Of course, with four inches of lead in your boot soles, 
and your head in a copper knob the size of a football, 
and been thirty-five minutes under water, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t break any records running. 1 ran like a ploughboy going to work. And halfway to the trees I saw a dozen niggers or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt more, coming out in a gaping, astonished sort of way tc meet me. 
. 253 
JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

‘I just stopped dead, and cursed myself for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt all the fools out of London. I had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned turtle. I just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free, and waited for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt them. There wasn’t anything else for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me to do. 

‘But they didn’t come on very much. I began to suspect why. “Jimmy Goggles,” I says, “it’s your beauty does it.” I was inclined to be a little light-headed, I think, 
with all these dangers about and the change in the pressure of the blessed air. “Who’re ye staring at?” I said, as if the savages could hear me. “What d’ye take me for? 
I’m hanged if I don’t give you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt something to stare at,” 
I said, and with that I screwed up the escape valve and turned on the compressed air from the belt, until I was swelled out like a blown frog. Regular imposing it must have been. I’m blessed if they’d come on a step; and presently one and then another went down on their hands and knees. They didn’t know what to make of roe, and they was doing the extra polite, which was very wise and reasonable of them. I had half a mind to edge back seaward and cut and run, but it seemed too hopeless. 
A step back and they’d have been after me. And out of sheer desperation I began to march towards them up the beach, with slow, heavy steps, and waving my blown-out arms about, in a dignified manner. And inside of me I was singing as small as a tomtit. 

‘But there’s nothing like a striking appearance to help a man over a difiiculty — I’ve found that before and since. 
People like ourselves, who’re up to diving-dresses by the time we’re seven, can scarcely imagine the effect of one on a simple-minded savage. One or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two of these niggers cut and run, the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their brains out on the ground. And on I went as slow and solemn and silly-looking and artful as a jobbing plumber. It was evident they took me for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt something immense. 
254 ' JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

‘Then up jumped one and began pointing, making extraordinary gestures to me as he did so, and all the others began sharing their attention between me and some- 
thing out at sea. “What’s the matter now,” I said. 1 turned slowly on account of my dignity, and there I saw, 
coming round a point, the poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt old Pride of Banya towed by a couple of canoes. The sight fairly made me sick. 
But they evidently expected some recognition, so I waved my arms in a striking sort of non-committal manner. And then I turned and stalked on towards the trees again. At that time I was praying like mad, I remember, over and over again: “Lord help me through with it! Lord help me through with it!” It’s only fools who know nothing of dangers can afford to laugh at praying. 

‘But these niggers weren’t going to let me walk through and away like that. They started a kind of bowing dance about me, and sort of pressed me to take a pathway that lay through the trees. It was clear to me they didn’t take me for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a British citizen, whatever else they thought of me, and for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part 1 was never less anxious to own up to the old country. 

‘You’d hardly believe it, perhaps, unless you’re familiar with savages, but these poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt misguided, ignorant creatures took me straight to their kind of joss place to present me to the blessed old black stone there. By this time I vvas beginning to sort of realize the depth of their ignorance, 
and directly 1 set eyes on this deity I took my cue. I started a baritone howl, “vvow-wow,” very long on one note, and began waving my arms about a lot, and then very slowly and ceremoniously turned their image over on its side and sat down on it. I wanted to sit down badly, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt diving-dresses ain’t much wear in the tropics. 
Or, to put it different like, they’re a sight too much. It took away their breath, I could see, my sitting on their joss, but in less time than a minute they made up their minds and were hard at work worshipping me. And I can 
JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 255 

tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I felt a bit relieved to see things turning out so well, in spite of the weight on my shoulders and feet. 

‘But what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think when they came back, bf they’d seen me in the boat before I went down, and without the helmet on — for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt they might have been spying and hiding since over night — they would very likely take a different view from the others. I was in a deuce of a stew about that for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt hours, as it seemed, until the shindy of the arrival began. 

‘But they took it down — ^the whole blessed village took it down. At the cost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting Egyptian images one sees as I could manage, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt pretty nearly twelve hours, I should guess at least, on end, I got over it. You’d hardly think what it meant in that heat and stink. I don’t think any of them dreamt of the man inside. I was just a wonderful leathery great joss that had come up with luck out of the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly close- 
ness! the mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! 
They lit a stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a lot of gory muck — the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside, the Beasts — 
and burnt it all in my honour. I was getting a bit hungry, 
but I understand now how gods manage to do without eating, what with the smell of burnt offerings about them. 
And they brought in a lot of the stuff they’d got off the brig and, among other stuff, what I was a bit relieved to see, the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the compressed air affair, and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me something disgraceful. 
It’s extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing respect. If I’d had a hatchet handy I’d have gone for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the lot of them — ^they made me feel that wild. 
All this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing any- 
thing better to do. And at last, when nightfall came. 
256 JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 

and the wattle joss-house place got a bit too shadowy for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt their taste — all these here savages are afraid of the dark, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know — and I started a sort of “Moo” noise, 
they built big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut, free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel just as bad as I liked. 
And, Lord ! I was sick. 

‘I was weak and hungry, and my mind kept on behaving like a beetle on a pin, tremendous activity and nothing done at the end of it. Come round just where it was before. There was sorrowing for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the other chaps, beastly drunkards certainly, but not deserving such a fate, and young Sanders with the spear through his neck wouldn’t go out of my mind. There was the treasure down there in the Ocean Pioneer, and how one might get it and hide it somewhere safer, and get away and come back for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it. 
And there was the puzzle where to get anything to eat. 
1 tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I was fair rambling. I was afraid to ask by signs for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt food, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fear of behaving too human, and so there 1 sat and hungered imtil very near the dawn. Then the village got a bit quiet, and I couldn’t stand it any longer, and I went out and got some stuff like artichokes in a bowl and some sour milk. What was left of these I put away among the other offerings, just to give them a hint of my tastes. And in the morning they came to worship, and found me sitting up stiff and respectable on their previous god, just as they’d left me overnight. I’d got my back against the central pillar of the hut, and, 
practically, I was asleep. And that’s how I became a god among the heathen— a false god no doubt, and blasphemous, 
but one can’t always pick and choose. 

‘Now, I don’t want to crack myself up as a god beyond my merits, but I must confess that while I was god to these people they was extraordinary successful. I don’t say there’s anything in it, mind you. They won a battle with another tribe— I got a lot of offerings I didn’t want through 
JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 257 

it — they had wonderful fishing, and their crop of pourra was exceptional fine. And they counted the capture of the brig among the benefits 1 brought ’em. I must say I don’t think that was a poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt record for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a perfectly new hand. 
And, though perhaps you’d scarcely credit it, I was the tribal god of those beastly savages for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt pretty nearly four months. . . . 

‘What else could I do, man? But I didn’t wear that diving-dress all the time. I made ’em rig me up a sort of holy of holies, and a deuce of a time I had, too, making them understand what it was I wanted them to do. That indeed was the great difficulty — making them understand my wishes. 1 couldn’t let myself down by talking their lingo badly — even if I’d been able to speak at all — and I couldn’t go flapping a lot of gestures at them. So I drew pictures in sand and sat down beside them and hooted like one o’clock. Sometimes they did the things I wanted all right, and sometimes they did them all wrong. 
They was always very willing, certainly. All the while I was puzzling how I was to get the confounded business settled. Every night before the dawn I used to march out in full rig and go off to a place v/here I could see the channel in which the Ocean Pioneer lay sunk, and once even, one moonlight night, I tried to walk out to her, but the weeds and rocks and dark clean beat me. 
I didn’t get back till full day, and then I found all those silly niggers out oa the beach praying their sea-god to return to them. I was that vexed and tired, messing and tumbling about, and coming up and going down again, 
I could have punched their silly heads all round when they started rejoicing. I’m hanged if I like so much ceremony. 

‘And then came the missionary. That missionary! It was in the afternoon, and I was sitting in state in my outer temple place, sitting on that old black stone of theirs when he came. I heard a row outside and jabbering, and then his voice speaking to an interpreter. “They worship

stocks and stones,” he said, and 1 knew what was up, in a flash. I had one of my windows out for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt comfort, and I sang out straigiit away on the spur of the moment. 
“Stocks and stones!” I says. “you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt come inside,” I said, 
“and ITl punch your blooming head.” There was a kind of silence and more jabbering, and in he came, Bible in hand, after the manner of them — a little sandy chap in specks and a pith helmet. 1 flatter myself that me sitting there in the shadows, with my copper head and my big goggles, struck him a bit of a heap at first. “Well,” I says, 
“how’s the trade in calico?” for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt I don’t hold with missionaries. 

‘I had a lark with that missionary. He was a raw hand, and quite outclassed with a man like me. He gasped out who was I, and I told him to read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know. Down he goes to read, 
and his interpreter, being of course as superstitious as any of them, took it as an act of worship and plumped down like a shot. All my people gave a howl of triumph, and there wasn’t any more business to be done in my village after that journey, not by the likes of him. 

‘But, of course, I was a fool to choke him off like that, 
if I’d had any sense 1 should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him into Co. I’ve no doubt he'd have come into Co. A child, with a few hours to think it over, could have seen the connection between my diving-dress and the loss of the Ocean Pioneer. A week after he left I went out one morning and saw the Mother- 
hood, the salver’s ship from Starr Race, towing up the channel and sounding. The whole blessed game was up, 
and all my trouble thrown away. Gummy? How wild I felt! And guying it in that stinking silly dress! Four months!’ 

The sunburnt man’s story degenerated again. ‘Think of il,’ he said, when he emerged to linguistic purity once more. ‘Forty thousand pounds* worth of gold.* 
JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD 259 

‘Did the little missionary come back?’ I asked. 

‘Oh yes! Bless him! And he pledged his reputation there was a man inside the god, and started out to see as much with tremendous ceremony. But there wasn’t — he got sold again. I always did hate scenes and explanations, 
and long before he came I was out of it all — going home to Banya along the coast, hiding in bushes by day, and thieving food from the villages by night. Only weapon, a spear. No clothes, no money. Nothing. My face was my fortune, as the saying is. And just a squeak of eight thousand pounds of gold — fifth share. But the natives cut up rusty, thank goodness, because they thought it was him had driven their luck away.’ 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

A Pantoum in Prose 

Ir is doubtful whether the gift was innate. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt my own part, I think it came to him suddenly. Indeed, until he was thirty he was a sceptic, and did not believe in miraculous powers. And here, since it is the most con- 
venient place, I must mention that he was a little man, 
and had eyes of a hot brown, \ei y erect red hair, a mous- 
tache with ends that he twisted up, and freckles. His name was George MeWhirter Fotheringay — not the sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miracles 
— and he was clerk at Gomshott’s. He was greatly addicted to assertive argument. It was while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary powers. This particular argument was being held in the bar of the Long Dragon, and Toddy Beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective ‘So you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say,’ that drove Mr. Fotheringay to the very limit of his patience. 

There were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist, landlord Cox, and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of the Dragon. Miss Maybridge was standing with her back to Mr. Fotheringay, 
washing glasses; the others were watching him, more or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive method. Goaded by the Torres Vedras tactics of Mr, 
Beamish, Mr. Fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort. ‘Looky here, Mr. Beamish,’ said Mr. 
Fotheringay. ‘Let us clearly understand what a miracle is. It’s something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of Will, something what couldn’t happen without being specially willed.’ 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 261 

‘So you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say,’ said Mr. Beamish, repulsing him. 

Mr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a silent auditor, and received his assent — ^given with a hesitating cough and a glance at Mr. Beamish. The landlord would express no opinion, and Mr. Fotheringay, 
returning to Mr. Beamish, received the unexpected con- 
cession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle. 

‘For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance,’ said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged. 
‘Here would be a miracle. That lamp, in the natural course of nature, couldn't burn like that iipsy-down, could it. Beamish?’ 

‘ you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say it couldn't,’ said Beamish. 

‘And you?’ said Fotheringay. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t mean to say — eh ? ’ 

‘No,’ said Beamish reluctantly. ‘No, it couldn’t.’ 

‘Very well,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. ‘Then here comes someone, as it might be me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and says to that lamp, as I might do, 
collecting all my will— “Turn upsy-down without breaking, 
and go on burning steady,” and Hullo!’ 

It was enough to make anyone say ‘Hullo!’ The impossible, the incredible, was visible to them all. The lamp hung inverted in the air, burning quietly with its flame pointing down. It was as solid, as indisputable as ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the Long Dragon bar. 

Mr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash. 
The cyclist, who was sitting next the lamp, ducked and jumped across the bar. Everybody jumped, more or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt less. 
Miss Maybridge turned and screamed. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt nearly three seconds the lapip remained still. A faint cry of mental distress came from Mr. Fotheringay. ‘I can’t keep it up,’ 
he said, ‘any longer.’ He staggered back, and the inverted lamp suddenly flared, fell against the corner of the bar, 
bounced aside, smashed upon the floor, and went out. 
262 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 
It was lucky it liad a metal receiver, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the whole place would have been in a blaze. Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his remark, shorn of needless excrescences, was to the effect that Fotheringay was a fool. Fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as that! He was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred. The subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as Fotheringay was concerned; the general opinion not only followed Mr. 
Cox very closely but very vehemently. Everyone accused Fotheringay of a silly trick, and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security. His mind was in a tornado of perplexity, he was himself inclined to agree with them, and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure. 

He went home flushed and heated, coat*collar crumpled, 
eyes smarting and ears red. He watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it. It was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in Church Row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the occurrence, and ask, ‘What on earth happened?’ 

He had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed with his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the seventeenth time, ‘7 didn’t want the confounded thing to upset,’ when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said, and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be done. He had not a particularly complex mind, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt he might have stuck for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time at that 
‘inadvertently willed,’ embracing, as it does, the abstrusest problems of voluntary action; but as it was, the idea came to him with a quite acceptable haziness. And from that, 
following, as I must admit, no clear logical path, he came to the test of experiment. 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 263 

He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind, though he felt he did a foolish thing. ‘Be raised up,’ he said. But in a second that feeling vanished. The candle was raised, hung in the air one giddy moment, and as Mr. Fothcringay gasped, fell with a smash on his toilet- 
table, leaving him in darkness save for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the expiring glow of its wick. 

For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time Mr. Fothcringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still. ‘It did happen, after all,’ he said. ‘And ’ow I’m to explain it I dont know.’ He sighed heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a match. He could find none, 
and he rose and groped about the toilet-table. ‘I wish I had a match,’ he said. He resorted to his coat, and there were none there, and then it dawned upon him that miracles wore possible even with matches. He extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark. ‘Let there be a match in that hand,’ he said. He felt some light object fall across his palm, and his fingers closed upon a match. 

After several ineffectual attempts to light this, he dis- 
covered it was a safety-match. He threw it down, and then it occurred to him that he might have willed it lit. 
He did, and perceived it burning in the midst of his toilet- 
table mat. He caught it up hastily, and it went out. 
His perception of possibilities enlarged, and he felt for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt and replaced the candle in its candlestick. ‘Here! you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt be lit,’ said Mr. Fothcringay, and forthwith the candle was flaring, and he saw a little black hole in the toilet -cover, 
with a wisp of smoke rising from ii. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time he stared from this to the little flame and back, and then looked up and met his own gaze in the looking-glass. 
By this help he communed with himself in silence for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time. 

‘How about miracles now^?’ said Mr. Fothcringay at last, addressing his reflection. 

The subsequent meditations of Mr. Fothcringay were 
264 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

of a severe but confused description. So far as he could see, it was a case of pure willing with him. The nature of his first experiences disinclined him for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt any further experiments except of the most cautious type. But he lifted a sheet of paper, and turned a glass of water pink and then green, and he created a snail, which he miracu- 
lously annihilated, and got himself a miraculous new tooth- 
brush. Somewhen in the small hours he had reached the fact that his will-power must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality, a fact of which he had certainly had inklings before, but no certain assurance. The scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage. He became aware that the church clock was striking one, and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at Gomshott’s might be miraculously dis- 
pensed with, he resumed undressing, in order to get to bed without further delay. As he struggled to get his shirt over his head, he was struck with a brilliant idea. 
‘Let me be in bed,’ he said, and found himself so. ‘Un- 
dressed,’ he stipulated; and, finding the sheets cold, added hastily, ‘and in my nightshirt — no, in a nice soft woollen nightshirt. Ah!’ he said with immense enjoyment. ‘And now let me be comfortably asleep. . . 

He awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast-time, wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid dream. At length his mind turned again to cautious experiments. For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance, 
he had three eggs for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt breakfast; two his landlady had supplied, good, but shoppy, and one was a delicious fresh goose-egg, laid, cooked, and served by his extraordinary will. He hurried off* to Gomshott’s in a state of profound but carefully concealed excitement, and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night. All day he could do no work because of this astonishing new self-knowledge, but this caused him no 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 265 

inconvenience, because he made up for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt it miraculously in his last ten minutes. 

As the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation, albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long Dragon were still disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage. It was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles, but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind. He intended among other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation. He called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs, and hastily annihilated them again as young Gomshott came across the counting-house to his desk. He was afraid young Gomshott might wonder how he had come by them. He saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise, but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling. It was that analogy, perhaps, quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the Long Dragon, that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gas-works, to rehearse a few miracles in private. 

There was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt apart from his will-power Mr. Fotheringay was not a very exceptional man. The miracle of Moses’ 
rod came to his mind, but the night was dark and un- 
favourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes. 
Then he recollected the story of ‘Tannhauser’ that he had read on the back of the Philharmonic programme. That seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless. He stuck his walking-stick — a very nice Poona-Penang lawyer 
—into the turf that edged the footpath, and commanded the dry wood to blossom. The air was immediately full of the scent of roses, and by means of a match he saw 
266 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accom- 
plished. His satisfaction was ended by advancing foot- 
steps. Afraid of a premature discovery of his powers, 
he addressed the blossoming slick hastily: ‘Go back.’ 
What he meant was Change back’; but of course he was confused. The stick receded at a considerable velocity, 
and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person. ‘Who are you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt throwing brambles at, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt fool?’ cried a voice. ‘That got me the shin.’ 

‘Tm sorry, old chap,’ said Mr. Fotheringay, and then realizing the awkward nature of the explanation, caught nervously at his moustache. He saw Winch, one of the three immering constables, advancing. 

‘What d’yer mean by it?’ asked the constable. ‘Hullo! 
It’s you, is it? The gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!’ 

‘1 don’t mean anything by it,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 
‘Nothing at all.’ 

‘What d’yer do it for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt then?’ 

‘Oh, bother!’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 

‘Bother indeed! D’yer know that stick hurt? What d’yer do it for, eh?’ 

For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had done it for. His silence seemed to irritate Mr. 
Winch. ‘You’ve been assaulting the police, young man, 
this time. That’s what you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt done.’ 

‘ Look here, Mr. Winch,’ said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and confused, ‘ I’m very sorry. The fact is 

‘Well?’ 

He could think of no way but the truth. ‘I was working a miracle.’ He tried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would he couldn’t. 

‘Working a ! ’Ere, don’t you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt talk rot. Working 

a miracle, indeed! Miracle! Well, that’s down -right funny! Why, you’s the chap that don’t believe in 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 267 

miracles. . . . Fact is, this is another of your silly con- 
juring tricks— that's what this is. Now, 1 tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt ’ 

But Mr. Folheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to tell him. He realized he had given himself away, 
flung his valuable secret to all the winds of heaven. A violent gust of irritation swept him to action. He turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely. ‘Here,’ he said, 
‘Fve had enough of this, 1 have! I'll show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a silly conjuring trick, I will! Go to Hades! Go, now!’ 

He was alone! 

Mr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night, 
nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick. He returned to the town, scared and very quiet, 
and went to his bedroom. ‘ Lord ! ’ he said, ‘it’s a powerful gift— an extremely powerful gift. I didn't hardly mean as much as that. Not really. ... ] v/onder what Hades is like!’ 

He sat on the bed taking off his bools. Struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed. Jn the night he dreamt of the anger of Winch. 

The next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two interesting items of news. Someone had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder Mr. Gomshott’s private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the river as far as Raw'ling’s Mill was to be dragged for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Constable Winch. 

Mr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful ail that Jay, and performed no miracles except certain provisions for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt Winch, and tlie miracle of completing his day’s work with punctual perfection in spite of all the bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind. And the extraordinary abstraction and metkness of his manner was remarked by several people, and made a matter for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt jesting. 
For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the most part he v/as thinking of Winch. 

On Sunday evening he went to chapel, and oddly enough. 
268 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

Mr. Maydig, who took a certain interest in occult matters, 
preached about ‘things that are not lawful.’ Mr. 
Fothcringay was not a regular chapel goer, but the system of assertive scepticism, to which I have already alluded, 
was now very much shaken. The tenor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel gifts, and he suddenly decided to consult Mr. Maydig immediately after tlie service. So soon as that was determined, he found himself wondering why he had not done so before. 

Mr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and neck, was gratified at a request for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a private conversation from a young man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt general remark in the town. After a few necessary delays, lie conducted him to the study of the Manse, which was contiguous to the chapel, seated him comfortably, and, standing in front of a cheerful fire — his legs threw a Rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall— requested Mr. Fothcringay to state his business. 

At first Mr. Fothcringay was a little abashed, and found some difficulty in opening the matter. ‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will scarcely believe me, Mr. Maydig, 1 am afraid’ — and so forth for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt some time. He tried a question at last, and asked Mr. 
Maydig his opinion of miracles. 

Mr. Maydig was still saying ‘Well’ in an extremely judicial tone, when Mr. Fotheringay interrupted again; 
‘you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt don’t believe, I suppose, that some common sort of person— like myself, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance— as it might be sitting here now, might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able to do things by his will.’ 

‘It’s possible,’ said Mr. Maydig. ‘Something of the sort, perhaps, is possible.’ 

‘If I might make free with something here, I think I might show you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt by a sort of experiment,’ said Mr. 
Fotheringay. ‘Now, take that tobacco-jar on the table, 
for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance. What I want to know is whether what I am 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 269 

going to do with it is a miracle or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt not. Just half a minute Mr. Maydig, please,’ 

He knitted his brows, pointed to the tobacco-jar and said: ‘Be a bowl of vi’lets.’ 

The tobacco-jar did as it was ordered. 

Mr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers. 
He said nothing. Presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets; they were fresh-picked and very fine ones. Then he stared at Mr. Fotheringay again. 

‘How did you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt do that?’ he asked. 

Mr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache. ‘Just told it — 
and there you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are. Is that a miracle, or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt is it black art, 
or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt what is it? And what do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think's the matter with me? That’s what I want to a^k.’ 

‘It’s a most extraordinary occurrence.’ 

‘And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things like that than you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt did. Jt came quite sudden, 
it’s something odd about my will, 1 suppose, and that's as far as I can sec.’ 

‘Is //w/— the only thing. Could you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt do other things besides that?’ 

‘Lord, yes!’ said Mr. Fotheringay. ‘Just anything.’ 
He thought, and suddenly recalled a conjuring entertain- 
ment he had seen. ‘ Here! ’ He pointed. ‘ Change into a bowl of fish — no, not that — change into a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it. That’s better. 
you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see that, Mr. Maydig?’ 

‘It’s astonishing. It’s incredible. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are either a most extraordinary . . . But no ’ 

‘I could change it into anything,” said Mr. Fotheringay. 
‘Just anything. Here! be a pigeon, will you?’ 

In another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him. ‘Stop there, will you,’ said Mr. Fotheringay; 
and the pigeon hung motionless in the air. ‘I could 
270 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

change it back to a bowl of flowers,’ he said, and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle. 
‘1 expect you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt will want your pipe in a bit^’ he said, and restored the tobacco -jar. 

Mr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory silence. He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and, in a very gingerly manner, picked up the tobacco- 
jar, examined it, replaced it on the table. 'Well!' was the only expression of his feelings. 

‘Now, after that it's easier to explain what I came about,’ said Mr. Fotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange experiences, begin- 
ning with the affair of the lamp in the Long Dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to Winch. As he went on, the transient pride Mr. Maydig’s consternation had caused passed away; he became the very ordinary Mr. 
Fotheringay of everyday intercourse again. Mr. Maydig listened intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and his bearing changed also with the course of the narrative. 
Presently, while Mr. Fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg, the minister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand — 

‘It is possible,’ he said. ‘It is credible. It is amazing, 
of course, but it reconciles a number of difficulties. The power to work miracles is a gift — a peculiar quality like genius or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt second sight — hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people. But in this case ... I have alv/ays wondered at the miracles of Mahomet, and at Yogis’ miracles, and the miracles of Madame Blavatsky. 
But, of course! Yes, it is simply a gift! It carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker’ — Mr. 
Maydig’s voice sank — ‘his Grace the Duke of Argyll. 
Here we plumb some profounder law — deeper than the ordinary laws of nature. Yes — yes. Goon. Goon!’ 

Mr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with Winch, and Mr. Maydig. no longer overawed or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 271 

scared, began to jerk his limbs about and interject astonish- 
ment. ‘It’s this what troubled me most,’ proceeded Mr. 
Fotheringay; ‘it’s this I’m most mijitly in want of advice for; of course he’s at San Francisco — ^wherever San Francisco may be — but of course it's awkward for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt both of us, as you’ll see, Mr. Maydig. I don’t see how he can understand what has happened, and I dare say he's scared and exasperated something tremendous, and trying to get at me. I dare say he keeps on starting oflF to come here. I send him back, by a miracle, every few hours, 
when J think of it. And of course, that’s a thing he won’t be able to understand, and it’s bound to annoy him; 
and, of course, if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money. I done the best I could for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him, 
but of course it's difficult for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt him to put himself in my place. I thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know — if Hades is all it’s supposed to be -before I shifted him. In that case I suppose they’d have locked him up in San Francisco. Of course I willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly I thought of it. But, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see, I’m already in a deuce of a tangle ’ 

Mr. Maydig looked serious. ‘1 see you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are in a tangle. 
Yes, it’s a difficult position. How you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are to end it . . .’ 
He became diffuse and inconclusive. 

‘However, we’ll leave Winch for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a little and discuss the larger question. I don’t think this is a case of the black art or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt anything of the sort. I don’t think there is any taint of criminality about it at all, Mr. Fotheringay — none whatever, unless you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are suppressing material facts. No, 
it’s miracles — pure miracles — miracles, if I may say so, 
of the very highest class.’ 

He began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr. Fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm, looking worried. ‘I don’t see how I’m to manage about Winch,’ he said. 

‘A gift of working miracles— apparently a very powerful 
272 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

gift,’ said Mr. May dig, ‘will find a way about Winch — 
never fear. My dear Sir, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt are a most important man 
— a. man of the most astonishing possibilities. As evidence, 
for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt example! And in other ways, the things you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt may do . . .’ 

‘Yes, /’ ve thought of a thing or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 
‘But — some of the things came a bit twisty. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt saw that fish at first? Wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish. And I thought I'd ask someone.’ 

‘A proper course,’ said Mr. Maydig, ‘a very proper course — altogether the proper course.’ He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay. ‘ It’s practically an unlimited gift. Let us test your powers, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt instance. If they really are .. . If they really are all they seem to be.’ 

And so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little house behind the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday, Nov. 10, 1896, Mr. Fotheringay, 
egged on and inspired by Mr. Maydig, began to work miracles. The reader’s attention is specially and definitely called to the date. He will object, probably has already objected, that certain points in this story are improbable, 
that if any things of the sort already described had indeed occurred, they would have been in all the papers a year ago. The details immediately following he will find par- 
ticularly hard to accept, because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt she, the reader in ques- 
tion, must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago. Now a miracle is nothing if not improbable, and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in, a violent and unprecedented manner a year ago. 
In the subsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible, as every right-minded and reasonable reader will admit. But this is not the place for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the end of the story, being but little beyond the hither side of the middle. And at first the miracles worked by Mr. Fotheringay were timid little mirades— little things 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 273 

with the cups and parlour fitments, as feeble as the miracles of Theosophists, and, feeble as they were, they were received with awe by his collaborator. He would have preferred to settle the Winch business out of hand, but Mr. Maydig would not let him. But after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities, their sense of power grew, their imagination began to show signs of stimulation, 
and their ambition enlarged. Their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of Mrs. Minchin, 
Mr. Maydig’s housekeeper. The meal to which the minister conducted Mr. Fotheringay was certainly ill-laid and uninviting as refreshment for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt two industrious miracle- 
workers; but they were sealed, and Mr. Maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his house- 
keeper’s shortcomings, before it occurred lo Mr. Fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him. ‘Don’t you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think, 
Mr. Maydig,’ he said, ‘if it isn’t a liberty, I ’ 

‘My dear Mr. Fotheringay! Of course! No— I didn't think.’ 

Mr. Fotheringay waved his hand. ‘What shall wc have?’ he said, in a large, inclusive spirit, and, at Mr. 
Maydig's order, revised the supper very thoroughly. ‘As for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt me,’ he said, eyeing Mr. Maydig's selection, ‘I am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice Welsh rarebit, and I’ll order that. I ain’t much given to Burgundy,’ and forthwith stout and Welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command. They sat long at their supper, talking like equals, as Mr. Fotheringay presently perceived with a glow of surprise and gratification, 
of all the miracles they would presently do. ‘And, by the by, Mr. Maydig,’ said Mr. Fotheringay, ‘I might perhaps be able to help you— in a domestic way.’ 

‘Don’t quite follow,’ said Mr. Maydig, pouring out a glass of miraculous old Burgundy. 

Mr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of vacancy, and took a mouthful. ‘I was 
274 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

thinking/ he said, ‘I might be able (chum, chum) to work 
(chum, chum) a miracle with Mrs. M inchin (chum, chum ) — 
make her a better woman.’ 

Mr. Maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful. 

‘ She's She strongly objects to interference, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt 

know, Mr. Fotheringay. And — as a matter of fact — it’s well past eleven and she’s probably in bed and asleep. 
Do you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think, on the whole ’ 

Mr. Fotheringay considered these objections. ‘I don’t see that it shouldn’t be done in her sleep.’ 

For https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded. Mr. Fotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their case, perhaps, the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast. Mr. Maydig was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day, with an optimism that seemed even to Mr. Fothcringay’s supper senses a little forced and hectic, when a scries of confused noises from upstairs began. Their eyes exchanged interrogations, and Mr. Maydig left the room hastily. 
Mr. Fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her. 

In a minute or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt so the minister returned, his step light, 
his face radiant. ‘Wonderful!’ he said, ‘and touching! 
Most touching!’ 

He began pacing the hearthrug. ‘A repentance — a most touching repentance — through the crack of the door. 
Poor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt woman! A most wonderful change! She had got up. She must have got up at once. She had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box. And to confess it too! . . . But this gives us— it opens — a most amazing vista of possibilities. If we can work this miraculous change in her . . 

‘The thing’s unlimited seemingly,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 
‘And about Mr. Winch ’ 

‘Altogether unlimited.’ And from the hearthrug Mr. 
Maydig, waving the Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a 
TRE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 275 

scries of wonderful proposals— proposals he invented as he went along. 

Now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this story. Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called post -prandial. Suffice it, too, that the problem of Winch remained unsolved. Nor https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfil- 
ment. There were astonishing changes. The small hours found Mr. Maydig and Mr. Folheringay careering across the chilly market-square under the still moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. Maydig all flap and gesture, 
Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and no longer abashed at his greatness. They had reformed every drunkard in the Parliamentary division, changed all the beer and alcohol to water (Mr. Maydig had overruled Mr. 
Fotheringay on this point), they had, further, greatly improved the railway communication of the place, drained Flinders’ swamp, improved the soil of One Tree Hill, 
and cured the Vicar’s wart. And they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at South Bridge. 
‘The place,’ gasped Mr. Maydig, ‘won’t be the same place to-morrow! How surprised and thankful everyone will be!’ And just at that moment the church clock struck three. 

‘I say,’ said Mr. Fotheringay, ‘that’s three o’clock! 
I must be getting back. Tve got to be at business by eight. And besides, Mrs. Wimms ’ 

‘We’re only beginning,’ said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness of unlimited power. ‘We’re only beginning. 
Think of all the good we’re doing. When people wake ’ 

‘But ’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 

Mr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly. His eyes were bright and wild. ‘My dear chap,’ he said, ‘there’s no hurry. Look’ — he pointed to the moon at the zenith— 
‘Joshua!’ 
276 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 

‘Joshua?’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 

‘Joshua,’ said Mr. Maydig. ‘Why not? Stop it.’ 

Mr. Fotheringay looked at the moon. 

‘That’s a bit tall/ he said after a pause. 

‘Why not?’ said Mr. Maydig. ‘Of course it doesn't stop. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt stop the rotation of the earth, you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt know. 
Time stops. Jt isn’t as if we were doing harm.’ 

‘H’m!’ said Mr. Fotheringay. ‘Well.’ He sighed. 
‘I’ll try. Here ’ 

He buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe, with as good an assuiiiption of confidence as lay in his power. ‘Jest stop rotating, will you,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. 

Incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of dozens of miles a minute. In spite of the innumerable circles he was describing per second, he thought; for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt thought is wonderful — sometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch, sometimes as instantaneous as light. He thought in a second, and w'illed. ‘Let me come down safe and sound. Whatever else happens, let me down safe and sound.’ 

He willed it only just in time, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt his clothes, heated by his rapid flight through the air, were already beginning to singe. He came down with a forcible, but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of fresh- 
turned earth. A large mass of metal and masonry, extra- 
ordinarily like the clock-tower in the middle of the market- 
square, hit the earth near him, ricochetted over him, and flew into stonework, bricks, and masonry, like a bursting bomb. A hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg. There was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling dust, and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes. A vast wind roared throughout earth and heaven, so that he could scarcely lift his head to look. 
I’or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt a w'hile he was too breathless and astonished even to 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 277 

see where he was or https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt what had happened. And his first movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own. 

‘Lord!’ gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the gale, ‘Fve had a squeak! What’s gone wrong? 
Storms and thunder. And only a minute ago a fine night. 
It’s Maydig set me on to this sort of thing. What a wind! 
If I go on fooling in this way I’m bound to have a thundering accident! . . . 

‘Where’s Maydig?’ 

‘What a confounded mess everything's in!’ 

He looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit. The appearance of things was really extremely strange. ‘The sky’s all right anyhow,' said Mr. Fotheringay. 
‘And that’s about all that is all right. And even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up. But there’s the moon overhead. Just as it was just now. Bright as mid- 
day. But as for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the rest Where’s the village? 

Where’s — ^where’s anything? And what on earth set this wind a-blowing? /didn’t order no wdnd.’ 

Mr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, 
and after one failure, remained on all fours, holding on. 
He surveyed the moonlit world to leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head. ‘There's something seriously wrong,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. ‘And what it is 
— goodness knows.’ 

Far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no familiar shapes, only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers, the lightnings and thunderings of a swiftly rising storm. Near him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elm-tree, a smashed mass of splinters, shivered from boughs to base, and further q twisted mass of iron girders 
278 THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES^ 

— only too evidently the viaduct — rose out of the piledi confusion. 

you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see, when Mr. I'otheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe, he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon its surface. And the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour, and in these latitudes at more than half that pace. So that the village, and Mr. 
Maydig, and Mr. Fotheringay, and everybody and every- 
thing had been jerked violently forward at about nine: 
miles per second — that is to say, much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon. And every human being, every living creature, every house, and every tree — all the world as we know it — had been, 
so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed. That was all.' 

These things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully appreciate. But he perceived that his miracle had mis- 
carried, and with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him. He was in darkness now, 'for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the clouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon, and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail. A great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky, and, peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to windward, he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him. 

‘Maydig!’ screamed Mr. Fotheringay's feeble voice amid the elemental uproar. ‘Here! — Maydig!’ 

‘Stop!’ cried Mr. Fotheringay to the advancing water. 
‘Oh, for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt goodness’ sake, stop!’ 

‘Just a moment,’ said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder. ‘Stop jest a moment while I collect my thoughts. . . . And now what shall 1 do?’ he said. ‘What shall 1 do? Lord! I wish Maydig was about.’ 

‘1 know,’ said Mr. Fotheringay. “And for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt goodnesJ^’ 
sake let’s have it right this time.’ 
THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 279 

He remained on all fours, leaning against the wind, very intent to have everything right. 

‘Ah!’ he said. ‘Let nothing what Fm going to order happen until I say “Off!” . . . Lord! 1 wish Fd thought of that before!’ 

He lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting louder and louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak. 
‘Now then! — here goes! Mind about that what I said just now. In the first place, when all I’ve got to say is done, let me lose my miraculous power, let my will become just like anybody else’s will, and all these dangerous miracles be stopped. I don’t like them. Fd rather I didn’t work ’em. Ever so much. That’s the first thing. 
And the second is — let me be back just before the miracles begin; let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up. It’s a big job, but it’s the last. Have you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt got it? No more miracles, everything as it was — me back in the Long Dragon just before I drank my half-pint. 
That’s it! Yes.’ 

He dug his fingers into the mould, closed his eyes, and said ‘Off!’ 

Everything became perfectly still. He perceived that he was standing erect. 

‘So you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt say,’ said a voice. 

He opened his eyes. He was in the bar of the Long Dragon, arguing about miracles with Toddy Beamish. 
He had a vague sense of some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed. you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt see, except for https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt the loss of his miraculous powers, everything was back as it had been; his mind and memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began. So that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told here, 
knows nothing of all that is told here to this day. And among other things, of course, he still did not believe in miracles. 

‘I tell you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt that miracles, properly speaking, can’t possibly

happen,’ he said, ‘whatever you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt like to hold. And I’m prepared to prove it up to the hilt,’ 

‘That’s what you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt think,’ said Toddy Beamish, and 
‘Prove it if you https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.96635/2015.96635.The-Time-Machine_djvu.txt can.’ 

‘ Looky here, Mr. Beamish,’ said Mr. Fotheringay, ‘ Let us clearly understand what a miracle is. It’s something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of Will ’
